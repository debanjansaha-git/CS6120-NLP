        "I have seldom heard him\nmention her under any other name.",
        "In his eyes she eclipses and\npredominates the whole of her sex.",
        "It was not that he felt any emotion\nakin to love for Irene Adler.",
        "All emotions, and that one particularly,\nwere abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind.",
        "He\nwas, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\nthe world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\nfalse position.",
        "He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\nand a sneer.",
        "They were admirable things for the observer\u2014excellent for\ndrawing the veil from men\u2019s motives and actions.",
        "But for the trained\nreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\nadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\nthrow a doubt upon all his mental results.",
        "Grit in a sensitive\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\nbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his.",
        "And\nyet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\nAdler, of dubious and questionable memory.",
        "I had seen little of Holmes lately.",
        "My marriage had drifted us away\nfrom each other.",
        "My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\ninterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\nof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\nwhile Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\nsoul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\nbooks, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\nthe drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\nnature.",
        "He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\nand occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\nobservation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\nmysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.",
        "From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\nsummons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\nof the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\nfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland.",
        "Beyond these signs of\nhis activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.",
        "One night\u2014it was on the twentieth of March, 1888\u2014I was returning from a\njourney to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\nmy way led me through Baker Street.",
        "As I passed the well-remembered\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\nwith the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\nextraordinary powers.",
        "His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\nlooked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\nagainst the blind.",
        "He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him.",
        "To me, who\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\nstory.",
        "He was at work again.",
        "He had risen out of his drug-created\ndreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem.",
        "I rang the bell\nand was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.",
        "His manner was not effusive.",
        "It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\nto see me.",
        "With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner.",
        "Then he stood before the fire\nand looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.",
        "\u201cWedlock suits you,\u201d he remarked.",
        "\u201cI think, Watson, that you have put\non seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeven!\u201d I answered.",
        "\u201cIndeed, I should have thought a little more.",
        "Just a trifle more, I\nfancy, Watson.",
        "And in practice again, I observe.",
        "You did not tell me\nthat you intended to go into harness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, how do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cI see it, I deduce it.",
        "How do I know that you have been getting\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\nservant girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Holmes,\u201d said I, \u201cthis is too much.",
        "You would certainly have\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago.",
        "It is true that I had a\ncountry walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\nhave changed my clothes I can\u2019t imagine how you deduce it.",
        "As to Mary\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\nagain, I fail to see how you work it out.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.",
        "\u201cIt is simplicity itself,\u201d said he; \u201cmy eyes tell me that on the inside\nof your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\nscored by six almost parallel cuts.",
        "Obviously they have been caused by\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\norder to remove crusted mud from it.",
        "Hence, you see, my double\ndeduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey.",
        "As\nto your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\niodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\nforefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\u201d\n\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\nprocess of deduction.",
        "\u201cWhen I hear you give your reasons,\u201d I remarked,\n\u201cthe thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\nreasoning I am baffled until you explain your process.",
        "And yet I\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so,\u201d he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\ndown into an armchair.",
        "\u201cYou see, but you do not observe.",
        "The\ndistinction is clear.",
        "For example, you have frequently seen the steps\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrequently.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow often?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, some hundreds of times.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen how many are there?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many?",
        "I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so!",
        "You have not observed.",
        "And yet you have seen.",
        "That is just\nmy point.",
        "Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\nboth seen and observed.",
        "By the way, since you are interested in these\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\u201d He threw\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\nupon the table.",
        "\u201cIt came by the last post,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cRead it aloud.\u201d\n\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.",
        "\u201cThere will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\u2019clock,\u201d it\nsaid, \u201ca gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\ndeepest moment.",
        "Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\nEurope have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.",
        "This account of you we have from all quarters received.",
        "Be in your\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\nwear a mask.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is indeed a mystery,\u201d I remarked.",
        "\u201cWhat do you imagine that it\nmeans?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no data yet.",
        "It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\ndata.",
        "Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\ntheories to suit facts.",
        "But the note itself.",
        "What do you deduce from\nit?\u201d\n\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\nwritten.",
        "\u201cThe man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\u201d I remarked,\nendeavouring to imitate my companion\u2019s processes.",
        "\u201cSuch paper could not\nbe bought under half a crown a packet.",
        "It is peculiarly strong and\nstiff.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeculiar\u2014that is the very word,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cIt is not an English\npaper at all.",
        "Hold it up to the light.\u201d\n\nI did so, and saw a large \u201cE\u201d with a small \u201cg,\u201d a \u201cP,\u201d and a large \u201cG\u201d\nwith a small \u201ct\u201d woven into the texture of the paper.",
        "\u201cWhat do you make of that?\u201d asked Holmes.",
        "\u201cThe name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all.",
        "The \u2018G\u2019 with the small \u2018t\u2019 stands for \u2018Gesellschaft,\u2019\nwhich is the German for \u2018Company.\u2019 It is a customary contraction like\nour \u2018Co.\u2019 \u2018P,\u2019 of course, stands for \u2018Papier.\u2019 Now for the \u2018Eg.\u2019 Let us\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.\u201d He took down a heavy brown volume\nfrom his shelves.",
        "\u201cEglow, Eglonitz\u2014here we are, Egria.",
        "It is in a\nGerman-speaking country\u2014in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad.",
        "\u2018Remarkable\nas being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\nglass-factories and paper-mills.\u2019 Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\nthat?\u201d His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\nfrom his cigarette.",
        "\u201cThe paper was made in Bohemia,\u201d I said.",
        "\u201cPrecisely.",
        "And the man who wrote the note is a German.",
        "Do you note the\npeculiar construction of the sentence\u2014\u2018This account of you we have from\nall quarters received.\u2019 A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\nthat.",
        "It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs.",
        "It only\nremains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\nwrites upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\nface.",
        "And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\ndoubts.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\u2019 hoofs and grating\nwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell.",
        "Holmes\nwhistled.",
        "\u201cA pair, by the sound,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d he continued, glancing out of\nthe window.",
        "\u201cA nice little brougham and a pair of beauties.",
        "A hundred\nand fifty guineas apiece.",
        "There\u2019s money in this case, Watson, if there\nis nothing else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that I had better go, Holmes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a bit, Doctor.",
        "Stay where you are.",
        "I am lost without my Boswell.",
        "And this promises to be interesting.",
        "It would be a pity to miss it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut your client\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind him.",
        "I may want your help, and so may he.",
        "Here he comes.",
        "Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\u201d\n\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\npassage, paused immediately outside the door.",
        "Then there was a loud and\nauthoritative tap.",
        "\u201cCome in!\u201d said Holmes.",
        "A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\nin height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules.",
        "His dress was rich\nwith a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\ntaste.",
        "Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\nfronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\nthrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\nsecured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\nberyl.",
        "Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\ntrimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\nbarbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance.",
        "He\ncarried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\nwas still raised to it as he entered.",
        "From the lower part of the face\nhe appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\nand a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\nof obstinacy.",
        "\u201cYou had my note?\u201d he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\nmarked German accent.",
        "\u201cI told you that I would call.\u201d He looked from\none to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.",
        "\u201cPray take a seat,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cThis is my friend and colleague, Dr.",
        "Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.",
        "Whom\nhave I the honour to address?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.",
        "I\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\ndiscretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\nimportance.",
        "If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you\nalone.\u201d\n\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\nmy chair.",
        "\u201cIt is both, or none,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cYou may say before this\ngentleman anything which you may say to me.\u201d\n\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders.",
        "\u201cThen I must begin,\u201d said he,\n\u201cby binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\nthat time the matter will be of no importance.",
        "At present it is not too\nmuch to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\nEuropean history.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cAnd I.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will excuse this mask,\u201d continued our strange visitor.",
        "\u201cThe august\nperson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\nconfess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\nnot exactly my own.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was aware of it,\u201d said Holmes dryly.",
        "\u201cThe circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\nbe taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\nseriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe.",
        "To speak\nplainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\nkings of Bohemia.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was also aware of that,\u201d murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\nhis armchair and closing his eyes.",
        "Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\nmost incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.",
        "Holmes\nslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.",
        "\u201cIf your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\u201d he remarked, \u201cI\nshould be better able to advise you.\u201d\n\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\nuncontrollable agitation.",
        "Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\nthe mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground.",
        "\u201cYou are right,\u201d\nhe cried; \u201cI am the King.",
        "Why should I attempt to conceal it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, indeed?\u201d murmured Holmes.",
        "\u201cYour Majesty had not spoken before I\nwas aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\nBohemia.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you can understand,\u201d said our strange visitor, sitting down once\nmore and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \u201cyou can\nunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\nperson.",
        "Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to\nan agent without putting myself in his power.",
        "I have come _incognito_\nfrom Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, pray consult,\u201d said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.",
        "\u201cThe facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy\nvisit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,\nIrene Adler.",
        "The name is no doubt familiar to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cKindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\u201d murmured Holmes without\nopening his eyes.",
        "For many years he had adopted a system of docketing\nall paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to\nname a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\ninformation.",
        "In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between\nthat of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a\nmonograph upon the deep-sea fishes.",
        "\u201cLet me see!\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cHum!",
        "Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.",
        "Contralto\u2014hum!",
        "La Scala, hum!",
        "Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw\u2014yes!",
        "Retired from operatic stage\u2014ha!",
        "Living in London\u2014quite so!",
        "Your\nMajesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person,\nwrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting\nthose letters back.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely so.",
        "But how\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWas there a secret marriage?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo legal papers or certificates?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I fail to follow your Majesty.",
        "If this young person should\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\nprove their authenticity?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is the writing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPooh, pooh!",
        "Forgery.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy private note-paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cStolen.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy own seal.\u201d\n\n\u201cImitated.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy photograph.\u201d\n\n\u201cBought.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were both in the photograph.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, dear!",
        "That is very bad!",
        "Your Majesty has indeed committed an\nindiscretion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was mad\u2014insane.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have compromised yourself seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was only Crown Prince then.",
        "I was young.",
        "I am but thirty now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be recovered.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have tried and failed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Majesty must pay.",
        "It must be bought.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will not sell.\u201d\n\n\u201cStolen, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive attempts have been made.",
        "Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\nhouse.",
        "Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled.",
        "Twice she has\nbeen waylaid.",
        "There has been no result.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo sign of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely none.\u201d\n\nHolmes laughed.",
        "\u201cIt is quite a pretty little problem,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cBut a very serious one to me,\u201d returned the King reproachfully.",
        "\u201cVery, indeed.",
        "And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo ruin me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am about to be married.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I have heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\nScandinavia.",
        "You may know the strict principles of her family.",
        "She is\nherself the very soul of delicacy.",
        "A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct\nwould bring the matter to an end.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Irene Adler?\u201d\n\n\u201cThreatens to send them the photograph.",
        "And she will do it.",
        "I know that\nshe will do it.",
        "You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel.",
        "She\nhas the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most\nresolute of men.",
        "Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no\nlengths to which she would not go\u2014none.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are sure that she has not sent it yet?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause she has said that she would send it on the day when the\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed.",
        "That will be next Monday.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, then we have three days yet,\u201d said Holmes with a yawn.",
        "\u201cThat is\nvery fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into\njust at present.",
        "Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the\npresent?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.",
        "You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count\nVon Kramm.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\u201d\n\n\u201cPray do so.",
        "I shall be all anxiety.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, as to money?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have _carte blanche_.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely?\u201d\n\n\u201cI tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to\nhave that photograph.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd for present expenses?\u201d\n\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid\nit on the table.",
        "\u201cThere are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\u201d he\nsaid.",
        "Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it\nto him.",
        "\u201cAnd Mademoiselle\u2019s address?\u201d he asked.",
        "\u201cIs Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St.",
        "John\u2019s Wood.\u201d\n\nHolmes took a note of it.",
        "\u201cOne other question,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cWas the\nphotograph a cabinet?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have\nsome good news for you.",
        "And good-night, Watson,\u201d he added, as the\nwheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street.",
        "\u201cIf you will be\ngood enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o\u2019clock I should like\nto chat this little matter over with you.\u201d\n\n\nII.",
        "At three o\u2019clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not\nyet returned.",
        "The landlady informed me that he had left the house\nshortly after eight o\u2019clock in the morning.",
        "I sat down beside the fire,\nhowever, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.",
        "I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was\nsurrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were\nassociated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,\nthe nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a\ncharacter of its own.",
        "Indeed, apart from the nature of the\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which\nmade it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\nquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable\nmysteries.",
        "So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very\npossibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.",
        "It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\ngroom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\ndisreputable clothes, walked into the room.",
        "Accustomed as I was to my\nfriend\u2019s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three\ntimes before I was certain that it was indeed he.",
        "With a nod he\nvanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes\ntweed-suited and respectable, as of old.",
        "Putting his hands into his\npockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed\nheartily for some minutes.",
        "\u201cWell, really!\u201d he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he\nwas obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.",
        "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite too funny.",
        "I am sure you could never guess how I employed\nmy morning, or what I ended by doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine.",
        "I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and\nperhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so; but the sequel was rather unusual.",
        "I will tell you, however.",
        "I left the house a little after eight o\u2019clock this morning in the\ncharacter of a groom out of work.",
        "There is a wonderful sympathy and\nfreemasonry among horsey men.",
        "Be one of them, and you will know all\nthat there is to know.",
        "I soon found Briony Lodge.",
        "It is a _bijou_\nvilla, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to\nthe road, two stories.",
        "Chubb lock to the door.",
        "Large sitting-room on\nthe right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\nand those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could\nopen.",
        "Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house.",
        "I walked round it and\nexamined it closely from every point of view, but without noting\nanything else of interest.",
        "\u201cI then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there\nwas a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden.",
        "I lent\nthe ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in\nexchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,\nand as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say\nnothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was\nnot in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to\nlisten to.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what of Irene Adler?\u201d I asked.",
        "\u201cOh, she has turned all the men\u2019s heads down in that part.",
        "She is the\ndaintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet.",
        "So say the\nSerpentine-mews, to a man.",
        "She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\nout at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner.",
        "Seldom\ngoes out at other times, except when she sings.",
        "Has only one male\nvisitor, but a good deal of him.",
        "He is dark, handsome, and dashing,\nnever calls less than once a day, and often twice.",
        "He is a Mr.",
        "Godfrey\nNorton, of the Inner Temple.",
        "See the advantages of a cabman as a\nconfidant.",
        "They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,\nand knew all about him.",
        "When I had listened to all they had to tell, I\nbegan to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think\nover my plan of campaign.",
        "\u201cThis Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.",
        "He was a lawyer.",
        "That sounded ominous.",
        "What was the relation between\nthem, and what the object of his repeated visits?",
        "Was she his client,\nhis friend, or his mistress?",
        "If the former, she had probably\ntransferred the photograph to his keeping.",
        "If the latter, it was less\nlikely.",
        "On the issue of this question depended whether I should\ncontinue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\ngentleman\u2019s chambers in the Temple.",
        "It was a delicate point, and it\nwidened the field of my inquiry.",
        "I fear that I bore you with these\ndetails, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are\nto understand the situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am following you closely,\u201d I answered.",
        "\u201cI was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up\nto Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out.",
        "He was a remarkably\nhandsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached\u2014evidently the man of whom\nI had heard.",
        "He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman\nto wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of\na man who was thoroughly at home.",
        "\u201cHe was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of\nhim in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking\nexcitedly, and waving his arms.",
        "Of her I could see nothing.",
        "Presently\nhe emerged, looking even more flurried than before.",
        "As he stepped up to\nthe cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it\nearnestly, \u2018Drive like the devil,\u2019 he shouted, \u2018first to Gross &\nHankey\u2019s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St.",
        "Monica in the\nEdgeware Road.",
        "Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!\u2019\n\n\u201cAway they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well\nto follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman\nwith his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all\nthe tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles.",
        "It hadn\u2019t\npulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it.",
        "I only\ncaught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with\na face that a man might die for.",
        "\u201c\u2018The Church of St.",
        "Monica, John,\u2019 she cried, \u2018and half a sovereign if\nyou reach it in twenty minutes.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis was quite too good to lose, Watson.",
        "I was just balancing whether\nI should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a\ncab came through the street.",
        "The driver looked twice at such a shabby\nfare, but I jumped in before he could object.",
        "\u2018The Church of St.",
        "Monica,\u2019 said I, \u2018and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty\nminutes.\u2019 It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was\nclear enough what was in the wind.",
        "\u201cMy cabby drove fast.",
        "I don\u2019t think I ever drove faster, but the others\nwere there before us.",
        "The cab and the landau with their steaming horses\nwere in front of the door when I arrived.",
        "I paid the man and hurried\ninto the church.",
        "There was not a soul there save the two whom I had\nfollowed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with\nthem.",
        "They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar.",
        "I\nlounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a\nchurch.",
        "Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\nme, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.",
        "\u201c\u2018Thank God,\u2019 he cried.",
        "\u2018You\u2019ll do.",
        "Come!",
        "Come!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018What then?\u2019 I asked.",
        "\u201c\u2018Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\u2019t be legal.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I\nfound myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and\nvouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in\nthe secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,\nbachelor.",
        "It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman\nthanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the\nclergyman beamed on me in front.",
        "It was the most preposterous position\nin which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it\nthat started me laughing just now.",
        "It seems that there had been some\ninformality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused\nto marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky\nappearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the\nstreets in search of a best man.",
        "The bride gave me a sovereign, and I\nmean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\u201d said I; \u201cand what then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I found my plans very seriously menaced.",
        "It looked as if the\npair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt\nand energetic measures on my part.",
        "At the church door, however, they\nseparated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house.",
        "\u2018I\nshall drive out in the park at five as usual,\u2019 she said as she left\nhim.",
        "I heard no more.",
        "They drove away in different directions, and I\nwent off to make my own arrangements.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich are?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome cold beef and a glass of beer,\u201d he answered, ringing the bell.",
        "\u201cI\nhave been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still\nthis evening.",
        "By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall be delighted.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind breaking the law?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in the least.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor running a chance of arrest?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in a good cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, the cause is excellent!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I am your man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was sure that I might rely on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what is it you wish?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Mrs.",
        "Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.",
        "Now,\u201d he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our\nlandlady had provided, \u201cI must discuss it while I eat, for I have not\nmuch time.",
        "It is nearly five now.",
        "In two hours we must be on the scene\nof action.",
        "Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at\nseven.",
        "We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must leave that to me.",
        "I have already arranged what is to occur.",
        "There is only one point on which I must insist.",
        "You must not interfere,\ncome what may.",
        "You understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am to be neutral?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo do nothing whatever.",
        "There will probably be some small\nunpleasantness.",
        "Do not join in it.",
        "It will end in my being conveyed\ninto the house.",
        "Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window\nwill open.",
        "You are to station yourself close to that open window.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when I raise my hand\u2014so\u2014you will throw into the room what I give\nyou to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire.",
        "You\nquite follow me?\u201d\n\n\u201cEntirely.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is nothing very formidable,\u201d he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\nroll from his pocket.",
        "\u201cIt is an ordinary plumber\u2019s smoke-rocket, fitted\nwith a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.",
        "Your task is\nconfined to that.",
        "When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up\nby quite a number of people.",
        "You may then walk to the end of the\nstreet, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes.",
        "I hope that I have made\nmyself clear?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at\nthe signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and\nto wait you at the corner of the street.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you may entirely rely on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is excellent.",
        "I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare\nfor the new role I have to play.\u201d\n\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the\ncharacter of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman.",
        "His\nbroad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic\nsmile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such\nas Mr.",
        "John Hare alone could have equalled.",
        "It was not merely that\nHolmes changed his costume.",
        "His expression, his manner, his very soul\nseemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed.",
        "The stage lost a\nfine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a\nspecialist in crime.",
        "It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still\nwanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine\nAvenue.",
        "It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as\nwe paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming\nof its occupant.",
        "The house was just such as I had pictured it from\nSherlock Holmes\u2019 succinct description, but the locality appeared to be\nless private than I expected.",
        "On the contrary, for a small street in a\nquiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated.",
        "There was a group of\nshabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a\nscissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a\nnurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and\ndown with cigars in their mouths.",
        "\u201cYou see,\u201d remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\nhouse, \u201cthis marriage rather simplifies matters.",
        "The photograph becomes\na double-edged weapon now.",
        "The chances are that she would be as averse\nto its being seen by Mr.",
        "Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming\nto the eyes of his princess.",
        "Now the question is, Where are we to find\nthe photograph?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere, indeed?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is most unlikely that she carries it about with her.",
        "It is cabinet\nsize.",
        "Too large for easy concealment about a woman\u2019s dress.",
        "She knows\nthat the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched.",
        "Two\nattempts of the sort have already been made.",
        "We may take it, then, that\nshe does not carry it about with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer banker or her lawyer.",
        "There is that double possibility.",
        "But I am\ninclined to think neither.",
        "Women are naturally secretive, and they like\nto do their own secreting.",
        "Why should she hand it over to anyone else?",
        "She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what\nindirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\nbusiness man.",
        "Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\na few days.",
        "It must be where she can lay her hands upon it.",
        "It must be\nin her own house.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it has twice been burgled.\u201d\n\n\u201cPshaw!",
        "They did not know how to look.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how will you look?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not look.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get her to show me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she will refuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will not be able to.",
        "But I hear the rumble of wheels.",
        "It is her\ncarriage.",
        "Now carry out my orders to the letter.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the\ncurve of the avenue.",
        "It was a smart little landau which rattled up to\nthe door of Briony Lodge.",
        "As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\nthe corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\ncopper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with\nthe same intention.",
        "A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by\nthe two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\nscissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side.",
        "A blow was\nstruck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,\nwas the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks.",
        "Holmes\ndashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,\nhe gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely\ndown his face.",
        "At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\ndirection and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\ndressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\ncrowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man.",
        "Irene\nAdler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\nstood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\nthe hall, looking back into the street.",
        "\u201cIs the poor gentleman much hurt?\u201d she asked.",
        "\u201cHe is dead,\u201d cried several voices.",
        "\u201cNo, no, there\u2019s life in him!\u201d shouted another.",
        "\u201cBut he\u2019ll be gone\nbefore you can get him to hospital.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a brave fellow,\u201d said a woman.",
        "\u201cThey would have had the lady\u2019s\npurse and watch if it hadn\u2019t been for him.",
        "They were a gang, and a\nrough one, too.",
        "Ah, he\u2019s breathing now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t lie in the street.",
        "May we bring him in, marm?\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely.",
        "Bring him into the sitting-room.",
        "There is a comfortable sofa.",
        "This way, please!\u201d\n\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\nprincipal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by\nthe window.",
        "The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,\nso that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch.",
        "I do not know\nwhether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he\nwas playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of\nmyself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I\nwas conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon\nthe injured man.",
        "And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes\nto draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me.",
        "I hardened\nmy heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster.",
        "After all, I\nthought, we are not injuring her.",
        "We are but preventing her from\ninjuring another.",
        "Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\nis in need of air.",
        "A maid rushed across and threw open the window.",
        "At\nthe same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my\nrocket into the room with a cry of \u201cFire!\u201d The word was no sooner out\nof my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\nill\u2014gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids\u2014joined in a general shriek of\n\u201cFire!\u201d Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the\nopen window.",
        "I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later\nthe voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\nalarm.",
        "Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\nof the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend\u2019s arm\nin mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.",
        "He walked swiftly\nand in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the\nquiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.",
        "\u201cYou did it very nicely, Doctor,\u201d he remarked.",
        "\u201cNothing could have been\nbetter.",
        "It is all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have the photograph?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know where it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how did you find out?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe showed me, as I told you she would.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am still in the dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not wish to make a mystery,\u201d said he, laughing.",
        "\u201cThe matter was\nperfectly simple.",
        "You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was\nan accomplice.",
        "They were all engaged for the evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guessed as much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the\npalm of my hand.",
        "I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\nface, and became a piteous spectacle.",
        "It is an old trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat also I could fathom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen they carried me in.",
        "She was bound to have me in.",
        "What else could\nshe do?",
        "And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\nsuspected.",
        "It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to\nsee which.",
        "They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were\ncompelled to open the window, and you had your chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did that help you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was all-important.",
        "When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\nher instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most.",
        "It\nis a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\nadvantage of it.",
        "In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\nwas of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business.",
        "A married\nwoman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.",
        "Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\nmore precious to her than what we are in quest of.",
        "She would rush to\nsecure it.",
        "The alarm of fire was admirably done.",
        "The smoke and shouting\nwere enough to shake nerves of steel.",
        "She responded beautifully.",
        "The\nphotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\nbell-pull.",
        "She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\nshe half drew it out.",
        "When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\nreplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\nnot seen her since.",
        "I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\nhouse.",
        "I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\nbut the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\nseemed safer to wait.",
        "A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d I asked.",
        "\u201cOur quest is practically finished.",
        "I shall call with the King\nto-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us.",
        "We will be shown\ninto the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that\nwhen she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph.",
        "It might be\na satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when will you call?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt eight in the morning.",
        "She will not be up, so that we shall have a\nclear field.",
        "Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a\ncomplete change in her life and habits.",
        "I must wire to the King without\ndelay.\u201d\n\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door.",
        "He was\nsearching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\n\n\u201cGood-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\u201d\n\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve heard that voice before,\u201d said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit\nstreet.",
        "\u201cNow, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\u201d\n\n\nIII.",
        "I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast\nand coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the\nroom.",
        "\u201cYou have really got it!\u201d he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either\nshoulder and looking eagerly into his face.",
        "\u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you have hopes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have hopes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, come.",
        "I am all impatience to be gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must have a cab.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, my brougham is waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen that will simplify matters.\u201d We descended and started off once\nmore for Briony Lodge.",
        "\u201cIrene Adler is married,\u201d remarked Holmes.",
        "\u201cMarried!",
        "When?\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut to whom?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo an English lawyer named Norton.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she could not love him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am in hopes that she does.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why in hopes?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance.",
        "If\nthe lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty.",
        "If she does\nnot love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with\nyour Majesty\u2019s plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is true.",
        "And yet\u2014!",
        "Well!",
        "I wish she had been of my own station!",
        "What a queen she would have made!\u201d He relapsed into a moody silence,\nwhich was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.",
        "The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the\nsteps.",
        "She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\nbrougham.",
        "\u201cMr.",
        "Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\u201d said she.",
        "\u201cI am Mr.",
        "Holmes,\u201d answered my companion, looking at her with a\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.",
        "\u201cIndeed!",
        "My mistress told me that you were likely to call.",
        "She left\nthis morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for\nthe Continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\nsurprise.",
        "\u201cDo you mean that she has left England?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever to return.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the papers?\u201d asked the King hoarsely.",
        "\u201cAll is lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall see.\u201d He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\ndrawing-room, followed by the King and myself.",
        "The furniture was\nscattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open\ndrawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.",
        "Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,\nplunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter.",
        "The\nphotograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was\nsuperscribed to \u201cSherlock Holmes, Esq.",
        "To be left till called for.\u201d My\nfriend tore it open, and we all three read it together.",
        "It was dated at\nmidnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\n\n    \u201cMY DEAR MR.",
        "SHERLOCK HOLMES,\u2014You really did it very well.",
        "You took\n    me in completely.",
        "Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\n    suspicion.",
        "But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I\n    began to think.",
        "I had been warned against you months ago.",
        "I had\n    been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly\n    be you.",
        "And your address had been given me.",
        "Yet, with all this, you\n    made me reveal what you wanted to know.",
        "Even after I became\n    suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old\n    clergyman.",
        "But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.",
        "Male costume is nothing new to me.",
        "I often take advantage of the\n    freedom which it gives.",
        "I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,\n    ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came\n    down just as you departed.",
        "\u201cWell, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\n    really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr.",
        "Sherlock Holmes.",
        "Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for\n    the Temple to see my husband.",
        "\u201cWe both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so\n    formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you\n    call to-morrow.",
        "As to the photograph, your client may rest in\n    peace.",
        "I love and am loved by a better man than he.",
        "The King may do\n    what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly\n    wronged.",
        "I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a\n    weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\n    take in the future.",
        "I leave a photograph which he might care to\n    possess; and I remain, dear Mr.",
        "Sherlock Holmes,\n\n\n    \u201cVery truly yours,\n\n    \u201cIRENE NORTON, _n\u00e9e_ ADLER.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat a woman\u2014oh, what a woman!\u201d cried the King of Bohemia, when we had\nall three read this epistle.",
        "\u201cDid I not tell you how quick and resolute\nshe was?",
        "Would she not have made an admirable queen?",
        "Is it not a pity\nthat she was not on my level?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very\ndifferent level to your Majesty,\u201d said Holmes coldly.",
        "\u201cI am sorry that\nI have not been able to bring your Majesty\u2019s business to a more\nsuccessful conclusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, my dear sir,\u201d cried the King; \u201cnothing could be more\nsuccessful.",
        "I know that her word is inviolate.",
        "The photograph is now as\nsafe as if it were in the fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am immensely indebted to you.",
        "Pray tell me in what way I can reward\nyou.",
        "This ring\u2014\u201d He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and\nheld it out upon the palm of his hand.",
        "\u201cYour Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,\u201d\nsaid Holmes.",
        "\u201cYou have but to name it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis photograph!\u201d\n\nThe King stared at him in amazement.",
        "\u201cIrene\u2019s photograph!\u201d he cried.",
        "\u201cCertainly, if you wish it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank your Majesty.",
        "Then there is no more to be done in the matter.",
        "I have the honour to wish you a very good morning.\u201d He bowed, and,\nturning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched\nout to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.",
        "And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of\nBohemia, and how the best plans of Mr.",
        "Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a\nwoman\u2019s wit.",
        "He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I\nhave not heard him do it of late.",
        "And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or\nwhen he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable\ntitle of _the_ woman.",
        "II.",
        "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\n\n\n I had called upon my friend, Mr.",
        "Sherlock Holmes, one day in the\n autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very\n stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.",
        "With an\n apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled\n me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.",
        "\u201cYou could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,\u201d he\nsaid cordially.",
        "\u201cI was afraid that you were engaged.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I am.",
        "Very much so.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I can wait in the next room.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all.",
        "This gentleman, Mr.",
        "Wilson, has been my partner and helper\nin many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will\nbe of the utmost use to me in yours also.\u201d\n\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of\ngreeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small\nfat-encircled eyes.",
        "\u201cTry the settee,\u201d said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting\nhis fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods.",
        "\u201cI\nknow, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and\noutside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life.",
        "You have\nshown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to\nchronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish\nso many of my own little adventures.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\u201d I\nobserved.",
        "\u201cYou will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went\ninto the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that\nfor strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life\nitself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the\nimagination.\u201d\n\n\u201cA proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for\notherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your\nreason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right.",
        "Now, Mr.",
        "Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning,\nand to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular\nwhich I have listened to for some time.",
        "You have heard me remark that\nthe strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with\nthe larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where\nthere is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.",
        "As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the\npresent case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events\nis certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.",
        "Perhaps, Mr.",
        "Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence\nyour narrative.",
        "I ask you not merely because my friend Dr.",
        "Watson has\nnot heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the\nstory makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.",
        "As\na rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of\nevents, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar\ncases which occur to my memory.",
        "In the present instance I am forced to\nadmit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\u201d\n\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some\nlittle pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside\npocket of his greatcoat.",
        "As he glanced down the advertisement column,\nwith his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee,\nI took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my\ncompanion, to read the indications which might be presented by his\ndress or appearance.",
        "I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection.",
        "Our visitor bore\nevery mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese,\npompous, and slow.",
        "He wore rather baggy grey shepherd\u2019s check trousers,\na not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab\nwaistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of\nmetal dangling down as an ornament.",
        "A frayed top-hat and a faded brown\novercoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.",
        "Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man\nsave his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and\ndiscontent upon his features.",
        "Sherlock Holmes\u2019 quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head\nwith a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.",
        "\u201cBeyond the obvious\nfacts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff,\nthat he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done\na considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.\u201d\n\nMr.",
        "Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the\npaper, but his eyes upon my companion.",
        "\u201cHow, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.",
        "Holmes?\u201d\nhe asked.",
        "\u201cHow did you know, for example, that I did manual labour.",
        "It\u2019s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship\u2019s carpenter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour hands, my dear sir.",
        "Your right hand is quite a size larger than\nyour left.",
        "You have worked with it, and the muscles are more\ndeveloped.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,\nespecially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use\nan arc-and-compass breastpin.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, of course, I forgot that.",
        "But the writing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five\ninches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you\nrest it upon the desk?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, but China?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist\ncould only have been done in China.",
        "I have made a small study of tattoo\nmarks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject.",
        "That\ntrick of staining the fishes\u2019 scales of a delicate pink is quite\npeculiar to China.",
        "When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from\nyour watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.\u201d\n\nMr.",
        "Jabez Wilson laughed heavily.",
        "\u201cWell, I never!\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cI thought\nat first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was\nnothing in it after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI begin to think, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat I make a mistake in\nexplaining.",
        "\u2018_Omne ignotum pro magnifico_,\u2019 you know, and my poor\nlittle reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so\ncandid.",
        "Can you not find the advertisement, Mr.",
        "Wilson?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I have got it now,\u201d he answered with his thick red finger planted\nhalfway down the column.",
        "\u201cHere it is.",
        "This is what began it all.",
        "You\njust read it for yourself, sir.\u201d\n\nI took the paper from him and read as follows:\n\n\u201cTO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late\nEzekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., there is now another\nvacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of \u00a3 4 a\nweek for purely nominal services.",

        "Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in\nhigh spirits.",
        "\u201cIt is a little off the beaten track, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cAnd now, Mr.",
        "Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about\nyourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had\nupon your fortunes.",
        "You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper\nand the date.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is _The Morning Chronicle_ of April 27, 1890.",
        "Just two months ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good.",
        "Now, Mr.",

        "Sherlock Holmes,\u201d\nsaid Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \u201cI have a small pawnbroker\u2019s\nbusiness at Coburg Square, near the City.",
        "It\u2019s not a very large affair,\nand of late years it has not done more than just give me a living.",
        "I\nused to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I\nwould have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half\nwages so as to learn the business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the name of this obliging youth?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes.",
        "\u201cHis name is Vincent Spaulding, and he\u2019s not such a youth, either.",

        "I don\u2019t know that your assistant is not as\nremarkable as your advertisement.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, he has his faults, too,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Wilson.",
        "\u201cNever was such a fellow\nfor photography.",
        "Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be\nimproving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit\ninto its hole to develop his pictures.",
        "That is his main fault, but on\nthe whole he\u2019s a good worker.",
        "There\u2019s no vice in him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is still with you, I presume?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.",
        "He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking\nand keeps the place clean\u2014that\u2019s all I have in the house, for I am a\nwidower and never had any family.",
        "We live very quietly, sir, the three\nof us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do\nnothing more.",
        "\u201cThe first thing that put us out was that advertisement.",
        "Spaulding, he\ncame down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very\npaper in his hand, and he says:\n\n\u201c\u2018I wish to the Lord, Mr.",
        "Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Why that?\u2019 I asks.",
        "\u201c\u2018Why,\u2019 says he, \u2018here\u2019s another vacancy on the League of the\nRed-headed Men.",
        "It\u2019s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets\nit, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men,\nso that the trustees are at their wits\u2019 end what to do with the money.",
        "If my hair would only change colour, here\u2019s a nice little crib all\nready for me to step into.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Why, what is it, then?\u2019 I asked.",
        "You see, Mr.",
        "Holmes, I am a very\nstay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to\ngo to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the\ndoor-mat.",
        "In that way I didn\u2019t know much of what was going on outside,\nand I was always glad of a bit of news.",
        "\u201c\u2018Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?\u2019 he asked\nwith his eyes open.",
        "\u201c\u2018Never.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the\nvacancies.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018And what are they worth?\u2019 I asked.",
        "\u201c\u2018Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it\nneed not interfere very much with one\u2019s other occupations.\u2019\n\n\u201cWell, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the\nbusiness has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of\nhundred would have been very handy.",
        "\u201c\u2018Tell me all about it,\u2019 said I.",
        "\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said he, showing me the advertisement, \u2018you can see for\nyourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where\nyou should apply for particulars.",
        "As far as I can make out, the League\nwas founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very\npeculiar in his ways.",
        "He was himself red-headed, and he had a great\nsympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he\nhad left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with\ninstructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to\nmen whose hair is of that colour.",
        "From all I hear it is splendid pay\nand very little to do.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018But,\u2019 said I, \u2018there would be millions of red-headed men who would\napply.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Not so many as you might think,\u2019 he answered.",
        "\u2018You see it is really\nconfined to Londoners, and to grown men.",
        "This American had started from\nLondon when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.",
        "Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is\nlight red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery\nred.",
        "Now, if you cared to apply, Mr.",
        "Wilson, you would just walk in;\nbut perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of\nthe way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.\u2019\n\n\u201cNow, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my\nhair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if\nthere was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance\nas any man that I had ever met.",
        "Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so\nmuch about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered\nhim to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me.",
        "He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and\nstarted off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.",
        "\u201cI never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr.",
        "Holmes.",
        "From\nnorth, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his\nhair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.",
        "Fleet\nStreet was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope\u2019s Court looked like a\ncoster\u2019s orange barrow.",
        "I should not have thought there were so many in\nthe whole country as were brought together by that single\nadvertisement.",
        "Every shade of colour they were\u2014straw, lemon, orange,\nbrick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were\nnot many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint.",
        "When I saw how\nmany were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding\nwould not hear of it.",
        "How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed\nand pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up\nto the steps which led to the office.",
        "There was a double stream upon\nthe stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we\nwedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour experience has been a most entertaining one,\u201d remarked Holmes as\nhis client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.",
        "\u201cPray continue your very interesting statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a\ndeal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even\nredder than mine.",
        "He said a few words to each candidate as he came up,\nand then he always managed to find some fault in them which would\ndisqualify them.",
        "Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy\nmatter, after all.",
        "However, when our turn came the little man was much\nmore favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door\nas we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.",
        "\u201c\u2018This is Mr.",
        "Jabez Wilson,\u2019 said my assistant, \u2018and he is willing to\nfill a vacancy in the League.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018And he is admirably suited for it,\u2019 the other answered.",
        "\u2018He has every\nrequirement.",
        "I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.\u2019 He\ntook a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair\nuntil I felt quite bashful.",
        "Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my\nhand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.",
        "\u201c\u2018It would be injustice to hesitate,\u2019 said he.",
        "\u2018You will, however, I am\nsure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.\u2019 With that he seized\nmy hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.",
        "\u2018There is water in your eyes,\u2019 said he as he released me.",
        "\u2018I perceive\nthat all is as it should be.",
        "But we have to be careful, for we have\ntwice been deceived by wigs and once by paint.",
        "I could tell you tales\nof cobbler\u2019s wax which would disgust you with human nature.\u2019 He stepped\nover to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that\nthe vacancy was filled.",
        "A groan of disappointment came up from below,\nand the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was\nnot a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.",
        "\u201c\u2018My name,\u2019 said he, \u2018is Mr.",
        "Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the\npensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor.",
        "Are you a\nmarried man, Mr.",
        "Wilson?",
        "Have you a family?\u2019\n\n\u201cI answered that I had not.",
        "\u201cHis face fell immediately.",
        "\u201c\u2018Dear me!\u2019 he said gravely, \u2018that is very serious indeed!",
        "I am sorry\nto hear you say that.",
        "The fund was, of course, for the propagation and\nspread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance.",
        "It is\nexceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.\u2019\n\n\u201cMy face lengthened at this, Mr.",
        "Holmes, for I thought that I was not\nto have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few\nminutes he said that it would be all right.",
        "\u201c\u2018In the case of another,\u2019 said he, \u2018the objection might be fatal, but\nwe must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as\nyours.",
        "When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,\u2019 said I.",
        "\u201c\u2018Oh, never mind about that, Mr.",
        "Wilson!\u2019 said Vincent Spaulding.",
        "\u2018I\nshould be able to look after that for you.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018What would be the hours?\u2019 I asked.",
        "\u201c\u2018Ten to two.\u2019\n\n\u201cNow a pawnbroker\u2019s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.",
        "Holmes,\nespecially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;\nso it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.",
        "Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see\nto anything that turned up.",
        "\u201c\u2018That would suit me very well,\u2019 said I.",
        "\u2018And the pay?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Is \u00a3 4 a week.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018And the work?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Is purely nominal.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018What do you call purely nominal?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the\nwhole time.",
        "If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever.",
        "The\nwill is very clear upon that point.",
        "You don\u2019t comply with the\nconditions if you budge from the office during that time.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,\u2019 said\nI.",
        "\u201c\u2018No excuse will avail,\u2019 said Mr.",
        "Duncan Ross; \u2018neither sickness nor\nbusiness nor anything else.",
        "There you must stay, or you lose your\nbillet.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018And the work?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Is to copy out the _Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica_.",
        "There is the first\nvolume of it in that press.",
        "You must find your own ink, pens, and\nblotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair.",
        "Will you be ready\nto-morrow?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Certainly,\u2019 I answered.",
        "\u201c\u2018Then, good-bye, Mr.",
        "Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once\nmore on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to\ngain.\u2019 He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant,\nhardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good\nfortune.",
        "\u201cWell, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low\nspirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair\nmust be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I\ncould not imagine.",
        "It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could\nmake such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything\nso simple as copying out the _Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica_.",
        "Vincent\nSpaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had\nreasoned myself out of the whole thing.",
        "However, in the morning I\ndetermined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of\nink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I\nstarted off for Pope\u2019s Court.",
        "\u201cWell, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.",
        "The table was set out ready for me, and Mr.",
        "Duncan Ross was there to\nsee that I got fairly to work.",
        "He started me off upon the letter A, and\nthen he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all\nwas right with me.",
        "At two o\u2019clock he bade me good-day, complimented me\nupon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office\nafter me.",
        "\u201cThis went on day after day, Mr.",
        "Holmes, and on Saturday the manager\ncame in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week\u2019s work.",
        "It\nwas the same next week, and the same the week after.",
        "Every morning I\nwas there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two.",
        "By degrees Mr.",
        "Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a\ntime, he did not come in at all.",
        "Still, of course, I never dared to\nleave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,\nand the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would\nnot risk the loss of it.",
        "\u201cEight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and\nArchery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with\ndiligence that I might get on to the B\u2019s before very long.",
        "It cost me\nsomething in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my\nwritings.",
        "And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo an end?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.",
        "And no later than this morning.",
        "I went to my work as usual\nat ten o\u2019clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square\nof cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack.",
        "Here\nit is, and you can read for yourself.\u201d\n\nHe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of\nnote-paper.",
        "It read in this fashion:\n\n\u201cTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED.",
        "October 9, 1890.\u201d\n\n\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful\nface behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely\novertopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar\nof laughter.",
        "\u201cI cannot see that there is anything very funny,\u201d cried our client,\nflushing up to the roots of his flaming head.",
        "\u201cIf you can do nothing\nbetter than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he\nhad half risen.",
        "\u201cI really wouldn\u2019t miss your case for the world.",
        "It is\nmost refreshingly unusual.",
        "But there is, if you will excuse my saying\nso, something just a little funny about it.",
        "Pray what steps did you\ntake when you found the card upon the door?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was staggered, sir.",
        "I did not know what to do.",
        "Then I called at the\noffices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.",
        "Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the\nground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of\nthe Red-headed League.",
        "He said that he had never heard of any such\nbody.",
        "Then I asked him who Mr.",
        "Duncan Ross was.",
        "He answered that the\nname was new to him.",
        "\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said I, \u2018the gentleman at No.",
        "4.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018What, the red-headed man?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 said he, \u2018his name was William Morris.",
        "He was a solicitor and\nwas using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises\nwere ready.",
        "He moved out yesterday.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Where could I find him?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh, at his new offices.",
        "He did tell me the address.",
        "Yes, 17 King\nEdward Street, near St.",
        "Paul\u2019s.\u2019\n\n\u201cI started off, Mr.",
        "Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a\nmanufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of\neither Mr.",
        "William Morris or Mr.",
        "Duncan Ross.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did you do then?\u201d asked Holmes.",
        "\u201cI went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my\nassistant.",
        "But he could not help me in any way.",
        "He could only say that\nif I waited I should hear by post.",
        "But that was not quite good enough,\nMr.",
        "Holmes.",
        "I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,\nas I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk\nwho were in need of it, I came right away to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you did very wisely,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cYour case is an exceedingly\nremarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.",
        "From what you\nhave told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from\nit than might at first sight appear.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrave enough!\u201d said Mr.",
        "Jabez Wilson.",
        "\u201cWhy, I have lost four pound a\nweek.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as you are personally concerned,\u201d remarked Holmes, \u201cI do not\nsee that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league.",
        "On\nthe contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some \u00a3 30, to say\nnothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject\nwhich comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir.",
        "But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what\ntheir object was in playing this prank\u2014if it was a prank\u2014upon me.",
        "It\nwas a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty\npounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall endeavour to clear up these points for you.",
        "And, first, one\nor two questions, Mr.",
        "Wilson.",
        "This assistant of yours who first called\nyour attention to the advertisement\u2014how long had he been with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout a month then.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did he come?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn answer to an advertisement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas he the only applicant?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I had a dozen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you pick him?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he was handy and would come cheap.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt half wages, in fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?\u201d\n\n\u201cSmall, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,\nthough he\u2019s not short of thirty.",
        "Has a white splash of acid upon his\nforehead.\u201d\n\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement.",

        "He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a\nlad.\u201d\n\n\u201cHum!\u201d said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought.",

        "\u201cIt is a most mysterious\nbusiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a rule,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthe more bizarre a thing is the less\nmysterious it proves to be.",

        "Could your patients spare you for a few\nhours?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have nothing to do to-day.",
        "My practice is never very absorbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen put on your hat and come.",
        "I am going through the City first, and\nwe can have some lunch on the way.",
        "I observe that there is a good deal\nof German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than\nItalian or French.",
        "It is introspective, and I want to introspect.",
        "Come\nalong!\u201d\n\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk\ntook us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we\nhad listened to in the morning.",
        "It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel\nplace, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out\ninto a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few\nclumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden\nand uncongenial atmosphere.",
        "Three gilt balls and a brown board with\n\u201cJABEZ WILSON\u201d in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the\nplace where our red-headed client carried on his business.",
        "Sherlock\nHolmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it\nall over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids.",
        "Then he\nwalked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still\nlooking keenly at the houses.",
        "Finally he returned to the pawnbroker\u2019s,\nand, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or\nthree times, he went up to the door and knocked.",
        "It was instantly\nopened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to\nstep in.",
        "\u201cThank you,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI only wished to ask you how you would go\nfrom here to the Strand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThird right, fourth left,\u201d answered the assistant promptly, closing\nthe door.",
        "\u201cSmart fellow, that,\u201d observed Holmes as we walked away.",
        "\u201cHe is, in my\njudgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not\nsure that he has not a claim to be third.",
        "I have known something of him\nbefore.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvidently,\u201d said I, \u201cMr.",
        "Wilson\u2019s assistant counts for a good deal in\nthis mystery of the Red-headed League.",
        "I am sure that you inquired your\nway merely in order that you might see him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe knees of his trousers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I expected to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you beat the pavement?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk.",
        "We are\nspies in an enemy\u2019s country.",
        "We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.",
        "Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\u201d\n\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from\nthe retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as\nthe front of a picture does to the back.",
        "It was one of the main\narteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west.",
        "The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in\na double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with\nthe hurrying swarm of pedestrians.",
        "It was difficult to realise as we\nlooked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that\nthey really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant\nsquare which we had just quitted.",
        "\u201cLet me see,\u201d said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along\nthe line, \u201cI should like just to remember the order of the houses here.",
        "It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London.",
        "There is\nMortimer\u2019s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg\nbranch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and\nMcFarlane\u2019s carriage-building depot.",
        "That carries us right on to the\nother block.",
        "And now, Doctor, we\u2019ve done our work, so it\u2019s time we had\nsome play.",
        "A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,\nwhere all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no\nred-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\u201d\n\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very\ncapable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit.",
        "All the\nafternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,\ngently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his\ngently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those\nof Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,\nready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive.",
        "In his\nsingular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his\nextreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought,\nthe reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\noccasionally predominated in him.",
        "The swing of his nature took him from\nextreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never\nso truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in\nhis armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.",
        "Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,\nand that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of\nintuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would\nlook askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other\nmortals.",
        "When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St.",
        "James\u2019s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom\nhe had set himself to hunt down.",
        "\u201cYou want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,\u201d he remarked as we emerged.",
        "\u201cYes, it would be as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I have some business to do which will take some hours.",
        "This\nbusiness at Coburg Square is serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy serious?\u201d\n\n\u201cA considerable crime is in contemplation.",
        "I have every reason to\nbelieve that we shall be in time to stop it.",
        "But to-day being Saturday\nrather complicates matters.",
        "I shall want your help to-night.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt what time?\u201d\n\n\u201cTen will be early enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall be at Baker Street at ten.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well.",
        "And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so\nkindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\u201d He waved his hand,\nturned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.",
        "I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always\noppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock\nHolmes.",
        "Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had\nseen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not\nonly what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the\nwhole business was still confused and grotesque.",
        "As I drove home to my\nhouse in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story\nof the red-headed copier of the _Encyclop\u00e6dia_ down to the visit to\nSaxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from\nme.",
        "What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?",
        "Where were we going, and what were we to do?",
        "I had the hint from Holmes\nthat this smooth-faced pawnbroker\u2019s assistant was a formidable man\u2014a\nman who might play a deep game.",
        "I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it\nup in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an\nexplanation.",
        "It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way\nacross the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street.",
        "Two\nhansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard\nthe sound of voices from above.",
        "On entering his room, I found Holmes in\nanimated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter\nJones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin,\nsad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable\nfrock-coat.",
        "\u201cHa!",
        "Our party is complete,\u201d said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket\nand taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.",
        "\u201cWatson, I think you\nknow Mr.",
        "Jones, of Scotland Yard?",
        "Let me introduce you to Mr.",
        "Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night\u2019s adventure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,\u201d said Jones in his\nconsequential way.",
        "\u201cOur friend here is a wonderful man for starting a\nchase.",
        "All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\u201d\nobserved Mr.",
        "Merryweather gloomily.",
        "\u201cYou may place considerable confidence in Mr.",
        "Holmes, sir,\u201d said the\npolice agent loftily.",
        "\u201cHe has his own little methods, which are, if he\nwon\u2019t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,\nbut he has the makings of a detective in him.",
        "It is not too much to say\nthat once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the\nAgra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official\nforce.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, if you say so, Mr.",
        "Jones, it is all right,\u201d said the stranger with\ndeference.",
        "\u201cStill, I confess that I miss my rubber.",
        "It is the first\nSaturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my\nrubber.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you will find,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, \u201cthat you will play for\na higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play\nwill be more exciting.",
        "For you, Mr.",
        "Merryweather, the stake will be\nsome \u00a3 30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you\nwish to lay your hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger.",
        "He\u2019s a young man,\nMr.",
        "Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would\nrather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London.",
        "He\u2019s a\nremarkable man, is young John Clay.",
        "His grandfather was a royal duke,\nand he himself has been to Eton and Oxford.",
        "His brain is as cunning as\nhis fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never\nknow where to find the man himself.",
        "He\u2019ll crack a crib in Scotland one\nweek, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.",
        "I\u2019ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.",
        "I\u2019ve\nhad one or two little turns also with Mr.",
        "John Clay, and I agree with\nyou that he is at the head of his profession.",
        "It is past ten, however,\nand quite time that we started.",
        "If you two will take the first hansom,\nWatson and I will follow in the second.\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and\nlay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the\nafternoon.",
        "We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets\nuntil we emerged into Farrington Street.",
        "\u201cWe are close there now,\u201d my friend remarked.",
        "\u201cThis fellow Merryweather\nis a bank director, and personally interested in the matter.",
        "I thought\nit as well to have Jones with us also.",
        "He is not a bad fellow, though\nan absolute imbecile in his profession.",
        "He has one positive virtue.",
        "He\nis as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his\nclaws upon anyone.",
        "Here we are, and they are waiting for us.\u201d\n\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\nourselves in the morning.",
        "Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the\nguidance of Mr.",
        "Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and\nthrough a side door, which he opened for us.",
        "Within there was a small\ncorridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate.",
        "This also was\nopened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated\nat another formidable gate.",
        "Mr.",
        "Merryweather stopped to light a\nlantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and\nso, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was\npiled all round with crates and massive boxes.",
        "\u201cYou are not very vulnerable from above,\u201d Holmes remarked as he held up\nthe lantern and gazed about him.",
        "\u201cNor from below,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Merryweather, striking his stick upon the\nflags which lined the floor.",
        "\u201cWhy, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\u201d he\nremarked, looking up in surprise.",
        "\u201cI must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\u201d said Holmes\nseverely.",
        "\u201cYou have already imperilled the whole success of our\nexpedition.",
        "Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down\nupon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\u201d\n\nThe solemn Mr.",
        "Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\ninjured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon\nthe floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine\nminutely the cracks between the stones.",
        "A few seconds sufficed to\nsatisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his\npocket.",
        "\u201cWe have at least an hour before us,\u201d he remarked, \u201cfor they can hardly\ntake any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.",
        "Then they\nwill not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer\ntime they will have for their escape.",
        "We are at present, Doctor\u2014as no\ndoubt you have divined\u2014in the cellar of the City branch of one of the\nprincipal London banks.",
        "Mr.",
        "Merryweather is the chairman of directors,\nand he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring\ncriminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar\nat present.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is our French gold,\u201d whispered the director.",
        "\u201cWe have had several\nwarnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour French gold?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
        "We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\nborrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France.",
        "It\nhas become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money,\nand that it is still lying in our cellar.",
        "The crate upon which I sit\ncontains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil.",
        "Our\nreserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a\nsingle branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the\nsubject.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich were very well justified,\u201d observed Holmes.",
        "\u201cAnd now it is time\nthat we arranged our little plans.",
        "I expect that within an hour matters\nwill come to a head.",
        "In the meantime Mr.",
        "Merryweather, we must put the\nscreen over that dark lantern.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd sit in the dark?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid so.",
        "I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I\nthought that, as we were a _partie carr\u00e9e_, you might have your rubber\nafter all.",
        "But I see that the enemy\u2019s preparations have gone so far\nthat we cannot risk the presence of a light.",
        "And, first of all, we must\nchoose our positions.",
        "These are daring men, and though we shall take\nthem at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.",
        "I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind\nthose.",
        "Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly.",
        "If they\nfire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.\u201d\n\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\nwhich I crouched.",
        "Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern\nand left us in pitch darkness\u2014such an absolute darkness as I have never\nbefore experienced.",
        "The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that\nthe light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment\u2019s notice.",
        "To\nme, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was\nsomething depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold\ndank air of the vault.",
        "\u201cThey have but one retreat,\u201d whispered Holmes.",
        "\u201cThat is back through\nthe house into Saxe-Coburg Square.",
        "I hope that you have done what I\nasked you, Jones?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we have stopped all the holes.",
        "And now we must be silent and\nwait.\u201d\n\nWhat a time it seemed!",
        "From comparing notes afterwards it was but an\nhour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have\nalmost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us.",
        "My limbs were weary and\nstiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up\nto the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I\ncould not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could\ndistinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the\nthin, sighing note of the bank director.",
        "From my position I could look\nover the case in the direction of the floor.",
        "Suddenly my eyes caught\nthe glint of a light.",
        "At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement.",
        "Then it\nlengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any\nwarning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,\nalmost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area\nof light.",
        "For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,\nprotruded out of the floor.",
        "Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it\nappeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which\nmarked a chink between the stones.",
        "Its disappearance, however, was but momentary.",
        "With a rending, tearing\nsound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and\nleft a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a\nlantern.",
        "Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which\nlooked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the\naperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee\nrested upon the edge.",
        "In another instant he stood at the side of the\nhole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like\nhimself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s all clear,\u201d he whispered.",
        "\u201cHave you the chisel and the bags?",
        "Great Scott!",
        "Jump, Archie, jump, and I\u2019ll swing for it!\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.",
        "The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth\nas Jones clutched at his skirts.",
        "The light flashed upon the barrel of a\nrevolver, but Holmes\u2019 hunting crop came down on the man\u2019s wrist, and\nthe pistol clinked upon the stone floor.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s no use, John Clay,\u201d said Holmes blandly.",
        "\u201cYou have no chance at\nall.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I see,\u201d the other answered with the utmost coolness.",
        "\u201cI fancy that\nmy pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are three men waiting for him at the door,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cOh, indeed!",
        "You seem to have done the thing very completely.",
        "I must\ncompliment you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I you,\u201d Holmes answered.",
        "\u201cYour red-headed idea was very new and\neffective.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see your pal again presently,\u201d said Jones.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s quicker at\nclimbing down holes than I am.",
        "Just hold out while I fix the derbies.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\u201d remarked our\nprisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.",
        "\u201cYou may not be\naware that I have royal blood in my veins.",
        "Have the goodness, also,\nwhen you address me always to say \u2018sir\u2019 and \u2018please.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Jones with a stare and a snigger.",
        "\u201cWell, would you\nplease, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your\nHighness to the police-station?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is better,\u201d said John Clay serenely.",
        "He made a sweeping bow to\nthe three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.",
        "\u201cReally, Mr.",
        "Holmes,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Merryweather as we followed them from\nthe cellar, \u201cI do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.",
        "There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most\ncomplete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery\nthat have ever come within my experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.",
        "John\nClay,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cI have been at some small expense over this\nmatter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am\namply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,\nand by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see, Watson,\u201d he explained in the early hours of the morning as we\nsat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \u201cit was perfectly\nobvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather\nfantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying\nof the _Encyclop\u00e6dia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker\nout of the way for a number of hours every day.",
        "It was a curious way of\nmanaging it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.",
        "The method was no doubt suggested to Clay\u2019s ingenious mind by the\ncolour of his accomplice\u2019s hair.",
        "The \u00a3 4 a week was a lure which must\ndraw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands?",
        "They\nput in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other\nrogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to\nsecure his absence every morning in the week.",
        "From the time that I\nheard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me\nthat he had some strong motive for securing the situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how could you guess what the motive was?\u201d\n\n\u201cHad there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere\nvulgar intrigue.",
        "That, however, was out of the question.",
        "The man\u2019s\nbusiness was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which\ncould account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure\nas they were at.",
        "It must, then, be something out of the house.",
        "What\ncould it be?",
        "I thought of the assistant\u2019s fondness for photography, and\nhis trick of vanishing into the cellar.",
        "The cellar!",
        "There was the end\nof this tangled clue.",
        "Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious\nassistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most\ndaring criminals in London.",
        "He was doing something in the\ncellar\u2014something which took many hours a day for months on end.",
        "What\ncould it be, once more?",
        "I could think of nothing save that he was\nrunning a tunnel to some other building.",
        "\u201cSo far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action.",
        "I\nsurprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick.",
        "I was\nascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.",
        "It\nwas not in front.",
        "Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant\nanswered it.",
        "We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes\nupon each other before.",
        "I hardly looked at his face.",
        "His knees were\nwhat I wished to see.",
        "You must yourself have remarked how worn,\nwrinkled, and stained they were.",
        "They spoke of those hours of\nburrowing.",
        "The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for.",
        "I\nwalked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our\nfriend\u2019s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem.",
        "When you\ndrove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the\nchairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?\u201d I\nasked.",
        "\u201cWell, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they\ncared no longer about Mr.",
        "Jabez Wilson\u2019s presence\u2014in other words, that\nthey had completed their tunnel.",
        "But it was essential that they should\nuse it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be\nremoved.",
        "Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it\nwould give them two days for their escape.",
        "For all these reasons I\nexpected them to come to-night.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou reasoned it out beautifully,\u201d I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration.",
        "\u201cIt is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt saved me from ennui,\u201d he answered, yawning.",
        "\u201cAlas!",
        "I already feel\nit closing in upon me.",
        "My life is spent in one long effort to escape\nfrom the commonplaces of existence.",
        "These little problems help me to do\nso.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you are a benefactor of the race,\u201d said I.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.",
        "\u201cWell, perhaps, after all, it is of some\nlittle use,\u201d he remarked.",
        "\u201c\u2018_L\u2019homme c\u2019est rien\u2014l\u2019\u0153uvre c\u2019est tout_,\u2019\nas Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIII.",
        "A CASE OF IDENTITY\n\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the\nfire in his lodgings at Baker Street, \u201clife is infinitely stranger than\nanything which the mind of man could invent.",
        "We would not dare to\nconceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence.",
        "If\nwe could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great\ncity, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which\nare going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the\ncross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through\ngenerations, and leading to the most _outr\u00e9_ results, it would make all\nfiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale\nand unprofitable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet I am not convinced of it,\u201d I answered.",
        "\u201cThe cases which come\nto light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.",
        "We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and\nyet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor\nartistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cA certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a\nrealistic effect,\u201d remarked Holmes.",
        "\u201cThis is wanting in the police\nreport, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the\nmagistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the\nvital essence of the whole matter.",
        "Depend upon it, there is nothing so\nunnatural as the commonplace.\u201d\n\nI smiled and shook my head.",
        "\u201cI can quite understand your thinking so,\u201d\nI said.",
        "\u201cOf course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper\nto everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,\nyou are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre.",
        "But\nhere\u201d\u2014I picked up the morning paper from the ground\u2014\u201clet us put it to a\npractical test.",
        "Here is the first heading upon which I come.",
        "\u2018A\nhusband\u2019s cruelty to his wife.\u2019 There is half a column of print, but I\nknow without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me.",
        "There\nis, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the\nbruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady.",
        "The crudest of writers\ncould invent nothing more crude.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\u201d said\nHolmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it.",
        "\u201cThis is the\nDundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing\nup some small points in connection with it.",
        "The husband was a\nteetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was\nthat he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking\nout his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will\nallow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the\naverage story-teller.",
        "Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge\nthat I have scored over you in your example.\u201d\n\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the\ncentre of the lid.",
        "Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely\nways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.",
        "\u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cI forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.",
        "It is\na little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance\nin the case of the Irene Adler papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the ring?\u201d I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which\nsparkled upon his finger.",
        "\u201cIt was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which\nI served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to\nyou, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little\nproblems.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd have you any on hand just now?\u201d I asked with interest.",
        "\u201cSome ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.",
        "They are important, you understand, without being interesting.",
        "Indeed,\nI have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a\nfield for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and\neffect which gives the charm to an investigation.",
        "The larger crimes are\napt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a\nrule, is the motive.",
        "In these cases, save for one rather intricate\nmatter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing\nwhich presents any features of interest.",
        "It is possible, however, that\nI may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this\nis one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.\u201d\n\nHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds\ngazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street.",
        "Looking over\nhis shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large\nwoman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red\nfeather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess\nof Devonshire fashion over her ear.",
        "From under this great panoply she\npeeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her\nbody oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her\nglove buttons.",
        "Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves\nthe bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of\nthe bell.",
        "\u201cI have seen those symptoms before,\u201d said Holmes, throwing his\ncigarette into the fire.",
        "\u201cOscillation upon the pavement always means an\n_affaire de c\u0153ur_.",
        "She would like advice, but is not sure that the\nmatter is not too delicate for communication.",
        "And yet even here we may\ndiscriminate.",
        "When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no\nlonger oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire.",
        "Here we\nmay take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so\nmuch angry as perplexed, or grieved.",
        "But here she comes in person to\nresolve our doubts.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered\nto announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind\nhis small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny\npilot boat.",
        "Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for\nwhich he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into\nan armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted\nfashion which was peculiar to him.",
        "\u201cDo you not find,\u201d he said, \u201cthat with your short sight it is a little\ntrying to do so much typewriting?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did at first,\u201d she answered, \u201cbut now I know where the letters are\nwithout looking.\u201d Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his\nwords, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and\nastonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019ve heard about\nme, Mr.",
        "Holmes,\u201d she cried, \u201celse how could you know all that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Holmes, laughing; \u201cit is my business to know things.",
        "Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook.",
        "If not, why\nshould you come to consult me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs.",
        "Etherege, whose\nhusband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up\nfor dead.",
        "Oh, Mr.",
        "Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me.",
        "I\u2019m not\nrich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the\nlittle that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what\nhas become of Mr.",
        "Hosmer Angel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\u201d asked Sherlock\nHolmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.",
        "Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary\nSutherland.",
        "\u201cYes, I did bang out of the house,\u201d she said, \u201cfor it made\nme angry to see the easy way in which Mr.",
        "Windibank\u2014that is, my\nfather\u2014took it all.",
        "He would not go to the police, and he would not go\nto you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that\nthere was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things\nand came right away to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cyour stepfather, surely, since the name is\ndifferent.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, my stepfather.",
        "I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,\nfor he is only five years and two months older than myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your mother is alive?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, mother is alive and well.",
        "I wasn\u2019t best pleased, Mr.",
        "Holmes,\nwhen she married again so soon after father\u2019s death, and a man who was\nnearly fifteen years younger than herself.",
        "Father was a plumber in the\nTottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which\nmother carried on with Mr.",
        "Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr.",
        "Windibank\ncame he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a\ntraveller in wines.",
        "They got \u00a3 4700 for the goodwill and interest,\nwhich wasn\u2019t near as much as father could have got if he had been\nalive.\u201d\n\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and\ninconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with\nthe greatest concentration of attention.",
        "\u201cYour own little income,\u201d he asked, \u201cdoes it come out of the business?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, sir.",
        "It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in\nAuckland.",
        "It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4\u00bd per cent.",
        "Two thousand\nfive hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou interest me extremely,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cAnd since you draw so large\na sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no\ndoubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way.",
        "I believe that\na single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about \u00a3 60.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could do with much less than that, Mr.",
        "Holmes, but you understand\nthat as long as I live at home I don\u2019t wish to be a burden to them, and\nso they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them.",
        "Of\ncourse, that is only just for the time.",
        "Mr.",
        "Windibank draws my interest\nevery quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do\npretty well with what I earn at typewriting.",
        "It brings me twopence a\nsheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have made your position very clear to me,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cThis is\nmy friend, Dr.",
        "Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before\nmyself.",
        "Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr.",
        "Hosmer\nAngel.\u201d\n\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland\u2019s face, and she picked nervously at\nthe fringe of her jacket.",
        "\u201cI met him first at the gasfitters\u2019 ball,\u201d\nshe said.",
        "\u201cThey used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then\nafterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother.",
        "Mr.",
        "Windibank\ndid not wish us to go.",
        "He never did wish us to go anywhere.",
        "He would\nget quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat.",
        "But\nthis time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to\nprevent?",
        "He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all\nfather\u2019s friends were to be there.",
        "And he said that I had nothing fit\nto wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken\nout of the drawer.",
        "At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to\nFrance upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with\nMr.",
        "Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr.",
        "Hosmer Angel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cthat when Mr.",
        "Windibank came back from\nFrance he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well, he was very good about it.",
        "He laughed, I remember, and\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a\nwoman, for she would have her way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.",
        "Then at the gasfitters\u2019 ball you met, as I understand, a\ngentleman called Mr.",
        "Hosmer Angel.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.",
        "I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we\nhad got home all safe, and after that we met him\u2014that is to say, Mr.",
        "Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back\nagain, and Mr.",
        "Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you know father didn\u2019t like anything of the sort.",
        "He wouldn\u2019t\nhave any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman\nshould be happy in her own family circle.",
        "But then, as I used to say to\nmother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got\nmine yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how about Mr.",
        "Hosmer Angel?",
        "Did he make no attempt to see you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote\nand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until\nhe had gone.",
        "We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every\nday.",
        "I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for\nfather to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, Mr.",
        "Holmes.",
        "We were engaged after the first walk that we\ntook.",
        "Hosmer\u2014Mr.",
        "Angel\u2014was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall\nStreet\u2014and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat office?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst of it, Mr.",
        "Holmes, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did he live, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe slept on the premises.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know his address?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014except that it was Leadenhall Street.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you address your letters, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for.",
        "He\nsaid that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all\nthe other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to\ntypewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn\u2019t have that, for he said\nthat when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were\ntypewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us.",
        "That\nwill just show you how fond he was of me, Mr.",
        "Holmes, and the little\nthings that he would think of.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was most suggestive,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cIt has long been an axiom of\nmine that the little things are infinitely the most important.",
        "Can you\nremember any other little things about Mr.",
        "Hosmer Angel?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a very shy man, Mr.",
        "Holmes.",
        "He would rather walk with me in the\nevening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be\nconspicuous.",
        "Very retiring and gentlemanly he was.",
        "Even his voice was\ngentle.",
        "He\u2019d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he\ntold me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,\nwhispering fashion of speech.",
        "He was always well dressed, very neat and\nplain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted\nglasses against the glare.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, and what happened when Mr.",
        "Windibank, your stepfather, returned\nto France?\u201d\n\n\u201cMr.",
        "Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should\nmarry before father came back.",
        "He was in dreadful earnest and made me\nswear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would\nalways be true to him.",
        "Mother said he was quite right to make me swear,\nand that it was a sign of his passion.",
        "Mother was all in his favour\nfrom the first and was even fonder of him than I was.",
        "Then, when they\ntalked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but\nthey both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him\nafterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him.",
        "I\ndidn\u2019t quite like that, Mr.",
        "Holmes.",
        "It seemed funny that I should ask\nhis leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn\u2019t want\nto do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the\ncompany has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the\nvery morning of the wedding.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt missed him, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa!",
        "that was unfortunate.",
        "Your wedding was arranged, then, for the\nFriday.",
        "Was it to be in church?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, but very quietly.",
        "It was to be at St.",
        "Saviour\u2019s, near King\u2019s\nCross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St.",
        "Pancras\nHotel.",
        "Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he\nput us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which\nhappened to be the only other cab in the street.",
        "We got to the church\nfirst, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step\nout, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and\nlooked there was no one there!",
        "The cabman said that he could not\nimagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own\neyes.",
        "That was last Friday, Mr.",
        "Holmes, and I have never seen or heard\nanything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,\u201d said\nHolmes.",
        "\u201cOh, no, sir!",
        "He was too good and kind to leave me so.",
        "Why, all the\nmorning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true;\nand that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I\nwas always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would\nclaim his pledge sooner or later.",
        "It seemed strange talk for a\nwedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost certainly it does.",
        "Your own opinion is, then, that some\nunforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.",
        "I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not\nhave talked so.",
        "And then I think that what he foresaw happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you have no notion as to what it could have been?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne more question.",
        "How did your mother take the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter\nagain.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your father?",
        "Did you tell him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and\nthat I should hear of Hosmer again.",
        "As he said, what interest could\nanyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving\nme?",
        "Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got\nmy money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was\nvery independent about money and never would look at a shilling of\nmine.",
        "And yet, what could have happened?",
        "And why could he not write?",
        "Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can\u2019t sleep a wink at\nnight.\u201d She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to\nsob heavily into it.",
        "\u201cI shall glance into the case for you,\u201d said Holmes, rising, \u201cand I\nhave no doubt that we shall reach some definite result.",
        "Let the weight\nof the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it\nfurther.",
        "Above all, try to let Mr.",
        "Hosmer Angel vanish from your\nmemory, as he has done from your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t think I\u2019ll see him again?\u201d\n\n\u201cI fear not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what has happened to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will leave that question in my hands.",
        "I should like an accurate\ndescription of him and any letters of his which you can spare.\u201d\n\n\u201cI advertised for him in last Saturday\u2019s _Chronicle_,\u201d said she.",
        "\u201cHere\nis the slip and here are four letters from him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.",
        "And your address?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
        "31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr.",
        "Angel\u2019s address you never had, I understand.",
        "Where is your\nfather\u2019s place of business?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of\nFenchurch Street.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.",
        "You have made your statement very clearly.",
        "You will leave\nthe papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you.",
        "Let\nthe whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your\nlife.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very kind, Mr.",
        "Holmes, but I cannot do that.",
        "I shall be true\nto Hosmer.",
        "He shall find me ready when he comes back.\u201d\n\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something\nnoble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.",
        "She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way,\nwith a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.",
        "Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still\npressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze\ndirected upward to the ceiling.",
        "Then he took down from the rack the old\nand oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit\nit, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths\nspinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.",
        "\u201cQuite an interesting study, that maiden,\u201d he observed.",
        "\u201cI found her\nmore interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather\na trite one.",
        "You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in\nAndover in \u201977, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last\nyear.",
        "Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which\nwere new to me.",
        "But the maiden herself was most instructive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to\nme,\u201d I remarked.",
        "\u201cNot invisible but unnoticed, Watson.",
        "You did not know where to look,\nand so you missed all that was important.",
        "I can never bring you to\nrealise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,\nor the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.",
        "Now, what did you\ngather from that woman\u2019s appearance?",
        "Describe it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a\nfeather of a brickish red.",
        "Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn\nupon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments.",
        "Her dress was\nbrown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at\nthe neck and sleeves.",
        "Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at\nthe right forefinger.",
        "Her boots I didn\u2019t observe.",
        "She had small round,\nhanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in\na vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.",
        "\u201c\u2019Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully.",
        "You have\nreally done very well indeed.",
        "It is true that you have missed\neverything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you\nhave a quick eye for colour.",
        "Never trust to general impressions, my\nboy, but concentrate yourself upon details.",
        "My first glance is always\nat a woman\u2019s sleeve.",
        "In a man it is perhaps better first to take the\nknee of the trouser.",
        "As you observe, this woman had plush upon her\nsleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces.",
        "The double\nline a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against\nthe table, was beautifully defined.",
        "The sewing-machine, of the hand\ntype, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side\nof it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the\nbroadest part, as this was.",
        "I then glanced at her face, and, observing\nthe dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark\nupon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt surprised me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, surely, it was obvious.",
        "I was then much surprised and interested\non glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was\nwearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one\nhaving a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one.",
        "One was\nbuttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at\nthe first, third, and fifth.",
        "Now, when you see that a young lady,\notherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,\nhalf-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a\nhurry.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what else?\u201d I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\nfriend\u2019s incisive reasoning.",
        "\u201cI noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home\nbut after being fully dressed.",
        "You observed that her right glove was\ntorn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove\nand finger were stained with violet ink.",
        "She had written in a hurry and\ndipped her pen too deep.",
        "It must have been this morning, or the mark\nwould not remain clear upon the finger.",
        "All this is amusing, though\nrather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson.",
        "Would you\nmind reading me the advertised description of Mr.",
        "Hosmer Angel?\u201d\n\nI held the little printed slip to the light.",
        "\u201cMissing,\u201d it said, \u201con\nthe morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel.",
        "About\nfive ft.",
        "seven in.",
        "in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black\nhair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and\nmoustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech.",
        "Was dressed,\nwhen last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat,\ngold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters\nover elastic-sided boots.",
        "Known to have been employed in an office in\nLeadenhall Street.",
        "Anybody bringing,\u201d &c, &c.",
        "\u201cThat will do,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cAs to the letters,\u201d he continued,\nglancing over them, \u201cthey are very commonplace.",
        "Absolutely no clue in\nthem to Mr.",
        "Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once.",
        "There is one\nremarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are typewritten,\u201d I remarked.",
        "\u201cNot only that, but the signature is typewritten.",
        "Look at the neat\nlittle \u2018Hosmer Angel\u2019 at the bottom.",
        "There is a date, you see, but no\nsuperscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague.",
        "The\npoint about the signature is very suggestive\u2014in fact, we may call it\nconclusive.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf what?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears\nupon the case?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to\ndeny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that was not the point.",
        "However, I shall write two letters, which\nshould settle the matter.",
        "One is to a firm in the City, the other is to\nthe young lady\u2019s stepfather, Mr.",
        "Windibank, asking him whether he could\nmeet us here at six o\u2019clock to-morrow evening.",
        "It is just as well that\nwe should do business with the male relatives.",
        "And now, Doctor, we can\ndo nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our\nlittle problem upon the shelf for the interim.\u201d\n\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend\u2019s subtle powers of\nreasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must\nhave some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which\nhe treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to\nfathom.",
        "Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of\nBohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to\nthe weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary\ncircumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would\nbe a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.",
        "I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\nconviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that\nhe held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity\nof the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.",
        "A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at\nthe time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the\nsufferer.",
        "It was not until close upon six o\u2019clock that I found myself\nfree and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street,\nhalf afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _d\u00e9nouement_ of\nthe little mystery.",
        "I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half\nasleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his\narmchair.",
        "A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the\npungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent\nhis day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.",
        "\u201cWell, have you solved it?\u201d I asked as I entered.",
        "\u201cYes.",
        "It was the bisulphate of baryta.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, the mystery!\u201d I cried.",
        "\u201cOh, that!",
        "I thought of the salt that I have been working upon.",
        "There\nwas never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some\nof the details are of interest.",
        "The only drawback is that there is no\nlaw, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss\nSutherland?\u201d\n\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened\nhis lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a\ntap at the door.",
        "\u201cThis is the girl\u2019s stepfather, Mr.",
        "James Windibank,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cHe\nhas written to me to say that he would be here at six.",
        "Come in!\u201d\n\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty\nyears of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland,\ninsinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating\ngrey eyes.",
        "He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny\ntop-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the\nnearest chair.",
        "\u201cGood-evening, Mr.",
        "James Windibank,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cI think that this\ntypewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with\nme for six o\u2019clock?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.",
        "I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my\nown master, you know.",
        "I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you\nabout this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash\nlinen of the sort in public.",
        "It was quite against my wishes that she\ncame, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have\nnoticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind\non a point.",
        "Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not\nconnected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a\nfamily misfortune like this noised abroad.",
        "Besides, it is a useless\nexpense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said Holmes quietly; \u201cI have every reason to believe\nthat I will succeed in discovering Mr.",
        "Hosmer Angel.\u201d\n\nMr.",
        "Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves.",
        "\u201cI am\ndelighted to hear it,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cIt is a curious thing,\u201d remarked Holmes, \u201cthat a typewriter has really\nquite as much individuality as a man\u2019s handwriting.",
        "Unless they are\nquite new, no two of them write exactly alike.",
        "Some letters get more\nworn than others, and some wear only on one side.",
        "Now, you remark in\nthis note of yours, Mr.",
        "Windibank, that in every case there is some\nlittle slurring over of the \u2018e,\u2019 and a slight defect in the tail of the\n\u2018r.\u2019 There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more\nobvious.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no\ndoubt it is a little worn,\u201d our visitor answered, glancing keenly at\nHolmes with his bright little eyes.",
        "\u201cAnd now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr.",
        "Windibank,\u201d Holmes continued.",
        "\u201cI think of writing another little\nmonograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to\ncrime.",
        "It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention.",
        "I\nhave here four letters which purport to come from the missing man.",
        "They\nare all typewritten.",
        "In each case, not only are the \u2018e\u2019s\u2019 slurred and\nthe \u2018r\u2019s\u2019 tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my\nmagnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I\nhave alluded are there as well.\u201d\n\nMr.",
        "Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat.",
        "\u201cI cannot\nwaste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr.",
        "Holmes,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cIf\nyou can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the\ndoor.",
        "\u201cI let you know, then, that I have caught him!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!",
        "where?\u201d shouted Mr.",
        "Windibank, turning white to his lips and\nglancing about him like a rat in a trap.",
        "\u201cOh, it won\u2019t do\u2014really it won\u2019t,\u201d said Holmes suavely.",
        "\u201cThere is no\npossible getting out of it, Mr.",
        "Windibank.",
        "It is quite too transparent,\nand it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible\nfor me to solve so simple a question.",
        "That\u2019s right!",
        "Sit down and let us\ntalk it over.\u201d\n\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter\nof moisture on his brow.",
        "\u201cIt\u2014it\u2019s not actionable,\u201d he stammered.",
        "\u201cI am very much afraid that it is not.",
        "But between ourselves,\nWindibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty\nway as ever came before me.",
        "Now, let me just run over the course of\nevents, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.\u201d\n\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his\nbreast, like one who is utterly crushed.",
        "Holmes stuck his feet up on\nthe corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his\npockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.",
        "\u201cThe man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cand he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long\nas she lived with them.",
        "It was a considerable sum, for people in their\nposition, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference.",
        "It\nwas worth an effort to preserve it.",
        "The daughter was of a good, amiable\ndisposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it\nwas evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little\nincome, she would not be allowed to remain single long.",
        "Now her\nmarriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what\ndoes her stepfather do to prevent it?",
        "He takes the obvious course of\nkeeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of\nher own age.",
        "But soon he found that that would not answer forever.",
        "She\nbecame restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her\npositive intention of going to a certain ball.",
        "What does her clever\nstepfather do then?",
        "He conceives an idea more creditable to his head\nthan to his heart.",
        "With the connivance and assistance of his wife he\ndisguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked\nthe face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear\nvoice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the\ngirl\u2019s short sight, he appears as Mr.",
        "Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other\nlovers by making love himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was only a joke at first,\u201d groaned our visitor.",
        "\u201cWe never thought\nthat she would have been so carried away.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery likely not.",
        "However that may be, the young lady was very\ndecidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her\nstepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an\ninstant entered her mind.",
        "She was flattered by the gentleman\u2019s\nattentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed\nadmiration of her mother.",
        "Then Mr.",
        "Angel began to call, for it was\nobvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\nreal effect were to be produced.",
        "There were meetings, and an\nengagement, which would finally secure the girl\u2019s affections from\nturning towards anyone else.",
        "But the deception could not be kept up\nforever.",
        "These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous.",
        "The\nthing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a\ndramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the\nyoung lady\u2019s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor\nfor some time to come.",
        "Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a\nTestament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something\nhappening on the very morning of the wedding.",
        "James Windibank wished\nMiss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to\nhis fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen\nto another man.",
        "As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as\nhe could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick\nof stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other.",
        "I\nthink that was the chain of events, Mr.",
        "Windibank!\u201d\n\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had\nbeen talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his\npale face.",
        "\u201cIt may be so, or it may not, Mr.",
        "Holmes,\u201d said he, \u201cbut if you are so\nvery sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are\nbreaking the law now, and not me.",
        "I have done nothing actionable from\nthe first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself\nopen to an action for assault and illegal constraint.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe law cannot, as you say, touch you,\u201d said Holmes, unlocking and\nthrowing open the door, \u201cyet there never was a man who deserved\npunishment more.",
        "If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought\nto lay a whip across your shoulders.",
        "By Jove!\u201d he continued, flushing\nup at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man\u2019s face, \u201cit is not\npart of my duties to my client, but here\u2019s a hunting crop handy, and I\nthink I shall just treat myself to\u2014\u201d He took two swift steps to the\nwhip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps\nupon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we\ncould see Mr.",
        "James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the\nroad.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s a cold-blooded scoundrel!\u201d said Holmes, laughing, as he threw\nhimself down into his chair once more.",
        "\u201cThat fellow will rise from\ncrime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.",
        "The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,\u201d I\nremarked.",
        "\u201cWell, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.",
        "Hosmer\nAngel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was\nequally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as\nfar as we could see, was the stepfather.",
        "Then the fact that the two men\nwere never together, but that the one always appeared when the other\nwas away, was suggestive.",
        "So were the tinted spectacles and the curious\nvoice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers.",
        "My\nsuspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his\nsignature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so\nfamiliar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of\nit.",
        "You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones,\nall pointed in the same direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how did you verify them?\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration.",

        "However innocent he might be, he could\nnot be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances\nwere very black against him.",
        "Had he appeared surprised at his own\narrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as\nhighly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural\nunder the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to\na scheming man.",
        "His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as\neither an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint\nand firmness.",
        "As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not\nunnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his\nfather, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far\nforgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,\naccording to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise\nhis hand as if to strike him.",

        "You will find\nit here, and may read it for yourself.\u201d\n\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper,\nand having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which\nthe unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had\noccurred.",

        "My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and\nI was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John\nCobb, the groom.",
        "Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap\nin the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk\nrapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he\nwas going.",
        "I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the\nBoscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which\nis upon the other side.",
        "On my way I saw William Crowder, the\ngame-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in\nthinking that I was following my father.",
        "I had no idea that he was in\nfront of me.",
        "When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of\n\u201cCooee!\u201d which was a usual signal between my father and myself.",
        "I then\nhurried forward, and found him standing by the pool.",
        "He appeared to be\nmuch surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was\ndoing there.",
        "A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost\nto blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper.",
        "Seeing that\nhis passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards\nHatherley Farm.",
        "I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I\nheard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again.",
        "I\nfound my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly\ninjured.",
        "I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost\ninstantly expired.",
        "I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made\nmy way to Mr.",

        "I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I\nhave no idea how he came by his injuries.",

        "\u201c\u2018Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes, it was gone.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018You cannot say what it was?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No, I had a feeling something was there.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018How far from the body?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018A dozen yards or so.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018And how far from the edge of the wood?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018About the same.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of\nit?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes, but with my back towards it.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis concluded the examination of the witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d said I as I glanced down the column, \u201cthat the coroner in his\nconcluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy.",
        "He calls\nattention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having\nsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details\nof his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his\nfather\u2019s dying words.",

        "Don\u2019t you see that you alternately give him credit for having\ntoo much imagination and too little?",
        "Too little, if he could not invent\na cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too\nmuch, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so\n_outr\u00e9_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the\nvanishing cloth.",
        "No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of\nview that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither\nthat hypothesis will lead us.",
        "And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and\nnot another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of\naction.",
        "We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty\nminutes.\u201d\n\nIt was nearly four o\u2019clock when we at last, after passing through the\nbeautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found\nourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross.",
        "A lean,\nferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the\nplatform.",
        "In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings\nwhich he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no\ndifficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard.",
        "With him we drove\nto the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.",
        "\u201cI have ordered a carriage,\u201d said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea.",
        "\u201cI knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until\nyou had been on the scene of the crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was very nice and complimentary of you,\u201d Holmes answered.",

        "Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes.",
        "\u201cYou may\nrely upon my doing all that I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you have read the evidence.",
        "You have formed some conclusion?",
        "Do\nyou not see some loophole, some flaw?",
        "Do you not yourself think that he\nis innocent?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that it is very probable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, now!\u201d she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly\nat Lestrade.",
        "\u201cYou hear!",
        "He gives me hopes.\u201d\n\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders.",
        "\u201cI am afraid that my colleague has\nbeen a little quick in forming his conclusions,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cBut he is right.",
        "Oh!",
        "I know that he is right.",
        "James never did it.",
        "And\nabout his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he\nwould not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn what way?\u201d asked Holmes.",
        "\u201cIt is no time for me to hide anything.",
        "James and his father had many\ndisagreements about me.",
        "Mr.",
        "McCarthy was very anxious that there should\nbe a marriage between us.",
        "James and I have always loved each other as\nbrother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little\nof life yet, and\u2014and\u2014well, he naturally did not wish to do anything\nlike that yet.",
        "So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of\nthem.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your father?\u201d asked Holmes.",
        "\u201cWas he in favour of such a union?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he was averse to it also.",
        "No one but Mr.",
        "McCarthy was in favour of\nit.\u201d A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one\nof his keen, questioning glances at her.",
        "\u201cThank you for this information,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cMay I see your father if I\ncall to-morrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid the doctor won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe doctor?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, have you not heard?",
        "Poor father has never been strong for years\nback, but this has broken him down completely.",
        "He has taken to his bed,\nand Dr.",
        "Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is\nshattered.",
        "Mr.",
        "McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the\nold days in Victoria.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa!",
        "In Victoria!",
        "That is important.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, at the mines.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr.",
        "Turner made\nhis money.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, certainly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Miss Turner.",
        "You have been of material assistance to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will tell me if you have any news to-morrow.",
        "No doubt you will go\nto the prison to see James.",
        "Oh, if you do, Mr.",
        "Holmes, do tell him that\nI know him to be innocent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, Miss Turner.\u201d\n\n\u201cI must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I\nleave him.",
        "Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\u201d She hurried\nfrom the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the\nwheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.",
        "\u201cI am ashamed of you, Holmes,\u201d said Lestrade with dignity after a few\nminutes\u2019 silence.",
        "\u201cWhy should you raise up hopes which you are bound to\ndisappoint?",
        "I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cHave you an order to see him in prison?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but only for you and me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I shall reconsider my resolution about going out.",
        "We have still\ntime to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\u201d\n\n\u201cAmple.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let us do so.",
        "Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but\nI shall only be away a couple of hours.\u201d\n\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the\nstreets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay\nupon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel.",
        "The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the\ndeep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention\nwander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung\nit across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of\nthe events of the day.",
        "Supposing that this unhappy young man\u2019s story\nwere absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely\nunforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the\ntime when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by\nhis screams, he rushed into the glade?",
        "It was something terrible and\ndeadly.",
        "What could it be?",
        "Might not the nature of the injuries reveal\nsomething to my medical instincts?",
        "I rang the bell and called for the\nweekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.",
        "In the surgeon\u2019s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of\nthe left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been\nshattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon.",
        "I marked the spot upon\nmy own head.",
        "Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind.",
        "That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen\nquarrelling he was face to face with his father.",
        "Still, it did not go\nfor very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the\nblow fell.",
        "Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes\u2019 attention to\nit.",
        "Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat.",
        "What could\nthat mean?",
        "It could not be delirium.",
        "A man dying from a sudden blow\ndoes not commonly become delirious.",
        "No, it was more likely to be an\nattempt to explain how he met his fate.",
        "But what could it indicate?",
        "I\ncudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation.",
        "And then the\nincident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy.",
        "If that were true\nthe murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his\novercoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and\nto carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back\nturned not a dozen paces off.",
        "What a tissue of mysteries and\nimprobabilities the whole thing was!",
        "I did not wonder at Lestrade\u2019s\nopinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes\u2019 insight that I\ncould not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen\nhis conviction of young McCarthy\u2019s innocence.",
        "It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned.",
        "He came back alone, for\nLestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.",
        "\u201cThe glass still keeps very high,\u201d he remarked as he sat down.",
        "\u201cIt is\nof importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the\nground.",
        "On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest\nfor such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by\na long journey.",
        "I have seen young McCarthy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what did you learn from him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould he throw no light?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone at all.",
        "I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had\ndone it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is\nas puzzled as everyone else.",
        "He is not a very quick-witted youth,\nthough comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot admire his taste,\u201d I remarked, \u201cif it is indeed a fact that\nhe was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss\nTurner.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, thereby hangs a rather painful tale.",
        "This fellow is madly,\ninsanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a\nlad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at\na boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of\na barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office?",
        "No one knows a\nword of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him\nto be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do,\nbut what he knows to be absolutely impossible.",
        "It was sheer frenzy of\nthis sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his\nfather, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss\nTurner.",
        "On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and\nhis father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown\nhim over utterly had he known the truth.",
        "It was with his barmaid wife\nthat he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did\nnot know where he was.",
        "Mark that point.",
        "It is of importance.",
        "Good has\ncome out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers\nthat he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him\nover utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband\nalready in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between\nthem.",
        "I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all\nthat he has suffered.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if he is innocent, who has done it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!",
        "who?",
        "I would call your attention very particularly to two points.",
        "One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the\npool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was\naway, and he did not know when he would return.",
        "The second is that the\nmurdered man was heard to cry \u2018Cooee!\u2019 before he knew that his son had\nreturned.",
        "Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends.",
        "And\nnow let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall\nleave all minor matters until to-morrow.\u201d\n\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright\nand cloudless.",
        "At nine o\u2019clock Lestrade called for us with the\ncarriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.",
        "\u201cThere is serious news this morning,\u201d Lestrade observed.",
        "\u201cIt is said\nthat Mr.",
        "Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn elderly man, I presume?\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cAbout sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life\nabroad, and he has been in failing health for some time.",
        "This business\nhas had a very bad effect upon him.",
        "He was an old friend of McCarthy\u2019s,\nand, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he\ngave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed!",
        "That is interesting,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cOh, yes!",
        "In a hundred other ways he has helped him.",
        "Everybody about\nhere speaks of his kindness to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally!",
        "Does it not strike you as a little singular that this\nMcCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been\nunder such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son\nto Turner\u2019s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and\nthat in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a\nproposal and all else would follow?",
        "It is the more strange, since we\nknow that Turner himself was averse to the idea.",
        "The daughter told us\nas much.",
        "Do you not deduce something from that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have got to the deductions and the inferences,\u201d said Lestrade,\nwinking at me.",
        "\u201cI find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without\nflying away after theories and fancies.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d said Holmes demurely; \u201cyou do find it very hard to\ntackle the facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to\nget hold of,\u201d replied Lestrade with some warmth.",
        "\u201cAnd that is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all\ntheories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\u201d said Holmes, laughing.",
        "\u201cBut I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the\nleft.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that is it.\u201d It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building,\ntwo-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon\nthe grey walls.",
        "The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,\ngave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay\nheavy upon it.",
        "We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes\u2019\nrequest, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his\ndeath, and also a pair of the son\u2019s, though not the pair which he had\nthen had.",
        "Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight\ndifferent points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from\nwhich we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.",
        "Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as\nthis.",
        "Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker\nStreet would have failed to recognise him.",
        "His face flushed and\ndarkened.",
        "His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his\neyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.",
        "His face was\nbent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins\nstood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck.",
        "His nostrils seemed\nto dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so\nabsolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or\nremark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a\nquick, impatient snarl in reply.",
        "Swiftly and silently he made his way\nalong the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the\nwoods to the Boscombe Pool.",
        "It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that\ndistrict, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and\namid the short grass which bounded it on either side.",
        "Sometimes Holmes\nwould hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little\ndetour into the meadow.",
        "Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective\nindifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the\ninterest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions\nwas directed towards a definite end.",
        "The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some\nfifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley\nFarm and the private park of the wealthy Mr.",
        "Turner.",
        "Above the woods\nwhich lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting\npinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner\u2019s dwelling.",
        "On\nthe Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was\na narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of\nthe trees and the reeds which lined the lake.",
        "Lestrade showed us the\nexact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was\nthe ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by\nthe fall of the stricken man.",
        "To Holmes, as I could see by his eager\nface and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the\ntrampled grass.",
        "He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and\nthen turned upon my companion.",
        "\u201cWhat did you go into the pool for?\u201d he asked.",
        "\u201cI fished about with a rake.",
        "I thought there might be some weapon or\nother trace.",
        "But how on earth\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, tut, tut!",
        "I have no time!",
        "That left foot of yours with its inward\ntwist is all over the place.",
        "A mole could trace it, and there it\nvanishes among the reeds.",
        "Oh, how simple it would all have been had I\nbeen here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over\nit.",
        "Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have\ncovered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body.",
        "But here are\nthree separate tracks of the same feet.\u201d He drew out a lens and lay\ndown upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time\nrather to himself than to us.",
        "\u201cThese are young McCarthy\u2019s feet.",
        "Twice\nhe was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply\nmarked and the heels hardly visible.",
        "That bears out his story.",
        "He ran\nwhen he saw his father on the ground.",
        "Then here are the father\u2019s feet\nas he paced up and down.",
        "What is this, then?",
        "It is the butt-end of the\ngun as the son stood listening.",
        "And this?",
        "Ha, ha!",
        "What have we here?",
        "Tiptoes!",
        "tiptoes!",
        "Square, too, quite unusual boots!",
        "They come, they go,\nthey come again\u2014of course that was for the cloak.",
        "Now where did they\ncome from?\u201d He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the\ntrack until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the\nshadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood.",
        "Holmes\ntraced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon\nhis face with a little cry of satisfaction.",
        "For a long time he remained\nthere, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what\nseemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens\nnot only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could\nreach.",
        "A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he\ncarefully examined and retained.",
        "Then he followed a pathway through the\nwood until he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.",
        "\u201cIt has been a case of considerable interest,\u201d he remarked, returning\nto his natural manner.",
        "\u201cI fancy that this grey house on the right must\nbe the lodge.",
        "I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and\nperhaps write a little note.",
        "Having done that, we may drive back to our\nluncheon.",
        "You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.\u201d\n\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into\nRoss, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up\nin the wood.",
        "\u201cThis may interest you, Lestrade,\u201d he remarked, holding it out.",
        "\u201cThe\nmurder was done with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see no marks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are none.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe grass was growing under it.",
        "It had only lain there a few days.",
        "There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken.",
        "It corresponds\nwith the injuries.",
        "There is no sign of any other weapon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the murderer?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears\nthick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses\na cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket.",
        "There are\nseveral other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our\nsearch.\u201d\n\nLestrade laughed.",
        "\u201cI am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cTheories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed\nBritish jury.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Nous verrons_,\u201d answered Holmes calmly.",
        "\u201cYou work your own method,\nand I shall work mine.",
        "I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall\nprobably return to London by the evening train.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd leave your case unfinished?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, finished.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the mystery?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is solved.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was the criminal, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gentleman I describe.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut who is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely it would not be difficult to find out.",
        "This is not such a\npopulous neighbourhood.\u201d\n\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders.",
        "\u201cI am a practical man,\u201d he said, \u201cand\nI really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a\nleft-handed gentleman with a game leg.",
        "I should become the\nlaughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Holmes quietly.",
        "\u201cI have given you the chance.",
        "Here\nare your lodgings.",
        "Good-bye.",
        "I shall drop you a line before I leave.\u201d\n\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we\nfound lunch upon the table.",
        "Holmes was silent and buried in thought\nwith a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a\nperplexing position.",
        "\u201cLook here, Watson,\u201d he said when the cloth was cleared \u201cjust sit down\nin this chair and let me preach to you for a little.",
        "I don\u2019t know quite\nwhat to do, and I should value your advice.",
        "Light a cigar and let me\nexpound.\u201d\n\n \u201cPray do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, now, in considering this case there are two points about young\nMcCarthy\u2019s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they\nimpressed me in his favour and you against him.",
        "One was the fact that\nhis father should, according to his account, cry \u2018Cooee!\u2019 before seeing\nhim.",
        "The other was his singular dying reference to a rat.",
        "He mumbled\nseveral words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son\u2019s\near.",
        "Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will\nbegin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat of this \u2018Cooee!\u2019 then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, obviously it could not have been meant for the son.",
        "The son, as\nfar as he knew, was in Bristol.",
        "It was mere chance that he was within\nearshot.",
        "The \u2018Cooee!\u2019 was meant to attract the attention of whoever it\nwas that he had the appointment with.",
        "But \u2018Cooee\u2019 is a distinctly\nAustralian cry, and one which is used between Australians.",
        "There is a\nstrong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him\nat Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat of the rat, then?\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it\nout on the table.",
        "\u201cThis is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cI wired to Bristol for it last night.\u201d He put his hand over part of\nthe map.",
        "\u201cWhat do you read?\u201d\n\n\u201cARAT,\u201d I read.",
        "\u201cAnd now?\u201d He raised his hand.",
        "\u201cBALLARAT.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so.",
        "That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only\ncaught the last two syllables.",
        "He was trying to utter the name of his\nmurderer.",
        "So and so, of Ballarat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is wonderful!\u201d I exclaimed.",
        "\u201cIt is obvious.",
        "And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down\nconsiderably.",
        "The possession of a grey garment was a third point which,\ngranting the son\u2019s statement to be correct, was a certainty.",
        "We have\ncome now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an\nAustralian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be\napproached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly\nwander.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen comes our expedition of to-day.",
        "By an examination of the ground I\ngained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as\nto the personality of the criminal.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how did you gain them?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know my method.",
        "It is founded upon the observation of trifles.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his\nstride.",
        "His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, they were peculiar boots.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut his lameness?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his\nleft.",
        "He put less weight upon it.",
        "Why?",
        "Because he limped\u2014he was lame.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut his left-handedness.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by\nthe surgeon at the inquest.",
        "The blow was struck from immediately\nbehind, and yet was upon the left side.",
        "Now, how can that be unless it\nwere by a left-handed man?",
        "He had stood behind that tree during the\ninterview between the father and son.",
        "He had even smoked there.",
        "I found\nthe ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables\nme to pronounce as an Indian cigar.",
        "I have, as you know, devoted some\nattention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140\ndifferent varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco.",
        "Having found\nthe ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss\nwhere he had tossed it.",
        "It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which\nare rolled in Rotterdam.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the cigar-holder?\u201d\n\n\u201cI could see that the end had not been in his mouth.",
        "Therefore he used\na holder.",
        "The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not\na clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\u201d\n\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I said, \u201cyou have drawn a net round this man from which he\ncannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if\nyou had cut the cord which was hanging him.",
        "I see the direction in\nwhich all this points.",
        "The culprit is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMr.",
        "John Turner,\u201d cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our\nsitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.",
        "The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure.",
        "His slow,\nlimping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude,\nand yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs\nshowed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of\ncharacter.",
        "His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping\neyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his\nappearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the\ncorners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue.",
        "It was clear\nto me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic\ndisease.",
        "\u201cPray sit down on the sofa,\u201d said Holmes gently.",
        "\u201cYou had my note?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, the lodge-keeper brought it up.",
        "You said that you wished to see\nme here to avoid scandal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why did you wish to see me?\u201d He looked across at my companion with\ndespair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words.",
        "\u201cIt is\nso.",
        "I know all about McCarthy.\u201d\n\nThe old man sank his face in his hands.",
        "\u201cGod help me!\u201d he cried.",
        "\u201cBut I\nwould not have let the young man come to harm.",
        "I give you my word that\nI would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad to hear you say so,\u201d said Holmes gravely.",
        "\u201cI would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl.",
        "It would\nbreak her heart\u2014it will break her heart when she hears that I am\narrested.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may not come to that,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am no official agent.",
        "I understand that it was your daughter who\nrequired my presence here, and I am acting in her interests.",
        "Young\nMcCarthy must be got off, however.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a dying man,\u201d said old Turner.",
        "\u201cI have had diabetes for years.",
        "My\ndoctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month.",
        "Yet I would\nrather die under my own roof than in a gaol.\u201d\n\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a\nbundle of paper before him.",
        "\u201cJust tell us the truth,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cI shall\njot down the facts.",
        "You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it.",
        "Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save\nyoung McCarthy.",
        "I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is\nabsolutely needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as well,\u201d said the old man; \u201cit\u2019s a question whether I shall live\nto the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare\nAlice the shock.",
        "And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has\nbeen a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.",
        "\u201cYou didn\u2019t know this dead man, McCarthy.",
        "He was a devil incarnate.",
        "I\ntell you that.",
        "God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.",
        "His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my\nlife.",
        "I\u2019ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.",
        "\u201cIt was in the early \u201960\u2019s at the diggings.",
        "I was a young chap then,\nhot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got\namong bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to\nthe bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway\nrobber.",
        "There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it,\nsticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the\nroad to the diggings.",
        "Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under,\nand our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.",
        "\u201cOne day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay\nin wait for it and attacked it.",
        "There were six troopers and six of us,\nso it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the\nfirst volley.",
        "Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the\nswag.",
        "I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this\nvery man McCarthy.",
        "I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I\nspared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as\nthough to remember every feature.",
        "We got away with the gold, became\nwealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected.",
        "There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a\nquiet and respectable life.",
        "I bought this estate, which chanced to be\nin the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to\nmake up for the way in which I had earned it.",
        "I married, too, and\nthough my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.",
        "Even when\nshe was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path\nas nothing else had ever done.",
        "In a word, I turned over a new leaf and\ndid my best to make up for the past.",
        "All was going well when McCarthy\nlaid his grip upon me.",
        "\u201cI had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent\nStreet with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.",
        "\u201c\u2018Here we are, Jack,\u2019 says he, touching me on the arm; \u2018we\u2019ll be as\ngood as a family to you.",
        "There\u2019s two of us, me and my son, and you can\nhave the keeping of us.",
        "If you don\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s a fine, law-abiding country\nis England, and there\u2019s always a policeman within hail.\u2019\n\n\u201cWell, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them\noff, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since.",
        "There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I\nwould, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow.",
        "It grew worse\nas Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my\npast than of the police.",
        "Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever\nit was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last\nhe asked a thing which I could not give.",
        "He asked for Alice.",
        "\u201cHis son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known\nto be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad\nshould step into the whole property.",
        "But there I was firm.",
        "I would not\nhave his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to\nthe lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough.",
        "I stood firm.",
        "McCarthy threatened.",
        "I braved him to do his worst.",
        "We were to meet at\nthe pool midway between our houses to talk it over.",
        "\u201cWhen I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a\ncigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone.",
        "But as I\nlistened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come\nuppermost.",
        "He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little\nregard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the\nstreets.",
        "It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear\nshould be in the power of such a man as this.",
        "Could I not snap the\nbond?",
        "I was already a dying and a desperate man.",
        "Though clear of mind\nand fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed.",
        "But my\nmemory and my girl!",
        "Both could be saved if I could but silence that\nfoul tongue.",
        "I did it, Mr.",
        "Holmes.",
        "I would do it again.",
        "Deeply as I\nhave sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it.",
        "But that\nmy girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more\nthan I could suffer.",
        "I struck him down with no more compunction than if\nhe had been some foul and venomous beast.",
        "His cry brought back his son;\nbut I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back\nto fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight.",
        "That is the true\nstory, gentlemen, of all that occurred.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it is not for me to judge you,\u201d said Holmes as the old man\nsigned the statement which had been drawn out.",
        "\u201cI pray that we may\nnever be exposed to such a temptation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI pray not, sir.",
        "And what do you intend to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn view of your health, nothing.",
        "You are yourself aware that you will\nsoon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes.",
        "I\nwill keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be\nforced to use it.",
        "If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and\nyour secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cFarewell, then,\u201d said the old man solemnly.",
        "\u201cYour own deathbeds, when\nthey come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you\nhave given to mine.\u201d Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he\nstumbled slowly from the room.",
        "\u201cGod help us!\u201d said Holmes after a long silence.",
        "\u201cWhy does fate play\nsuch tricks with poor, helpless worms?",
        "I never hear of such a case as\nthis that I do not think of Baxter\u2019s words, and say, \u2018There, but for\nthe grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.\u2019\u201d\n\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number\nof objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the\ndefending counsel.",
        "Old Turner lived for seven months after our\ninterview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son\nand daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the\nblack cloud which rests upon their past.",
        "V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS\n\n\nWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases\nbetween the years \u201982 and \u201990, I am faced by so many which present\nstrange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know\nwhich to choose and which to leave.",
        "Some, however, have already gained\npublicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for\nthose peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree,\nand which it is the object of these papers to illustrate.",
        "Some, too,\nhave baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives,\nbeginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially\ncleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture\nand surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to\nhim.",
        "There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in\nits details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give\nsome account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in\nconnection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,\nentirely cleared up.",
        "The year \u201987 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or\nless interest, of which I retain the records.",
        "Among my headings under\nthis one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the\nParadol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious\nclub in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts\nconnected with the loss of the British barque _Sophy Anderson_, of the\nsingular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and\nfinally of the Camberwell poisoning case.",
        "In the latter, as may be\nremembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man\u2019s\nwatch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that\ntherefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time\u2014a deduction\nwhich was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case.",
        "All these\nI may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such\nsingular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have\nnow taken up my pen to describe.",
        "It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had\nset in with exceptional violence.",
        "All day the wind had screamed and the\nrain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of\ngreat, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the\ninstant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those\ngreat elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his\ncivilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage.",
        "As evening drew in, the\nstorm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a\nchild in the chimney.",
        "Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the\nfireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was\ndeep in one of Clark Russell\u2019s fine sea-stories until the howl of the\ngale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the\nrain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves.",
        "My wife was\non a visit to her mother\u2019s, and for a few days I was a dweller once\nmore in my old quarters at Baker Street.",
        "\u201cWhy,\u201d said I, glancing up at my companion, \u201cthat was surely the bell.",
        "Who could come to-night?",
        "Some friend of yours, perhaps?\u201d\n\n\u201cExcept yourself I have none,\u201d he answered.",
        "\u201cI do not encourage\nvisitors.\u201d\n\n\u201cA client, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf so, it is a serious case.",
        "Nothing less would bring a man out on\nsuch a day and at such an hour.",
        "But I take it that it is more likely to\nbe some crony of the landlady\u2019s.\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a\nstep in the passage and a tapping at the door.",
        "He stretched out his\nlong arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant\nchair upon which a newcomer must sit.",
        "\u201cCome in!\u201d said he.",
        "The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,\nwell-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy\nin his bearing.",
        "The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and\nhis long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he\nhad come.",
        "He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I\ncould see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a\nman who is weighed down with some great anxiety.",
        "\u201cI owe you an apology,\u201d he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his\neyes.",
        "\u201cI trust that I am not intruding.",
        "I fear that I have brought some\ntraces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me your coat and umbrella,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cThey may rest here on\nthe hook and will be dry presently.",
        "You have come up from the\nsouth-west, I see.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, from Horsham.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite\ndistinctive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have come for advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is easily got.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd help.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not always so easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have heard of you, Mr.",
        "Holmes.",
        "I heard from Major Prendergast how\nyou saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, of course.",
        "He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said that you could solve anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat you are never beaten.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been beaten four times\u2014three times by men, and once by a\nwoman.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what is that compared with the number of your successes?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is true that I have been generally successful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you may be so with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with\nsome details as to your case.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is no ordinary one.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of those which come to me are.",
        "I am the last court of appeal.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have\never listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events\nthan those which have happened in my own family.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou fill me with interest,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cPray give us the essential\nfacts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to\nthose details which seem to me to be most important.\u201d\n\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards\nthe blaze.",
        "\u201cMy name,\u201d said he, \u201cis John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far\nas I can understand, little to do with this awful business.",
        "It is a\nhereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must\ngo back to the commencement of the affair.",
        "\u201cYou must know that my grandfather had two sons\u2014my uncle Elias and my\nfather Joseph.",
        "My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he\nenlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling.",
        "He was a patentee\nof the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such\nsuccess that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome\ncompetence.",
        "\u201cMy uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became\na planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well.",
        "At\nthe time of the war he fought in Jackson\u2019s army, and afterwards under\nHood, where he rose to be a colonel.",
        "When Lee laid down his arms my\nuncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four\nyears.",
        "About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small\nestate in Sussex, near Horsham.",
        "He had made a very considerable fortune\nin the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the\nnegroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the\nfranchise to them.",
        "He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered,\nvery foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring\ndisposition.",
        "During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if\never he set foot in the town.",
        "He had a garden and two or three fields\nround his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very\noften for weeks on end he would never leave his room.",
        "He drank a great\ndeal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and\ndid not want any friends, not even his own brother.",
        "\u201cHe didn\u2019t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time\nwhen he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so.",
        "This would be\nin the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England.",
        "He\nbegged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in\nhis way.",
        "When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and\ndraughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the\nservants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was\nsixteen I was quite master of the house.",
        "I kept all the keys and could\ngo where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him\nin his privacy.",
        "There was one singular exception, however, for he had a\nsingle room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably\nlocked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to\nenter.",
        "With a boy\u2019s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I\nwas never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and\nbundles as would be expected in such a room.",
        "\u201cOne day\u2014it was in March, 1883\u2014a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon\nthe table in front of the colonel\u2019s plate.",
        "It was not a common thing\nfor him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money,\nand he had no friends of any sort.",
        "\u2018From India!\u2019 said he as he took it\nup, \u2018Pondicherry postmark!",
        "What can this be?\u2019 Opening it hurriedly, out\nthere jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon\nhis plate.",
        "I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my\nlips at the sight of his face.",
        "His lip had fallen, his eyes were\nprotruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope\nwhich he still held in his trembling hand, \u2018K.",
        "K.",
        "K.!\u2019 he shrieked, and\nthen, \u2018My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018What is it, uncle?\u2019 I cried.",
        "\u201c\u2018Death,\u2019 said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room,\nleaving me palpitating with horror.",
        "I took up the envelope and saw\nscrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter\nK three times repeated.",
        "There was nothing else save the five dried\npips.",
        "What could be the reason of his overpowering terror?",
        "I left the\nbreakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with\nan old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand,\nand a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.",
        "\u201c\u2018They may do what they like, but I\u2019ll checkmate them still,\u2019 said he\nwith an oath.",
        "\u2018Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day,\nand send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\u2019\n\n\u201cI did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step\nup to the room.",
        "The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there\nwas a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass\nbox stood open and empty beside it.",
        "As I glanced at the box I noticed,\nwith a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had\nread in the morning upon the envelope.",
        "\u201c\u2018I wish you, John,\u2019 said my uncle, \u2018to witness my will.",
        "I leave my\nestate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my\nbrother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you.",
        "If you\ncan enjoy it in peace, well and good!",
        "If you find you cannot, take my\nadvice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy.",
        "I am sorry to\ngive you such a two-edged thing, but I can\u2019t say what turn things are\ngoing to take.",
        "Kindly sign the paper where Mr.",
        "Fordham shows you.\u2019\n\n\u201cI signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.",
        "The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression\nupon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind\nwithout being able to make anything of it.",
        "Yet I could not shake off\nthe vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation\ngrew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the\nusual routine of our lives.",
        "I could see a change in my uncle, however.",
        "He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of\nsociety.",
        "Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door\nlocked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of\ndrunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the\ngarden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of\nno man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by\nman or devil.",
        "When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush\ntumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man\nwho can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the\nroots of his soul.",
        "At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold\nday, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.",
        "\u201cWell, to come to an end of the matter, Mr.",
        "Holmes, and not to abuse\nyour patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken\nsallies from which he never came back.",
        "We found him, when we went to\nsearch for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay\nat the foot of the garden.",
        "There was no sign of any violence, and the\nwater was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his\nknown eccentricity, brought in a verdict of \u2018suicide.\u2019 But I, who knew\nhow he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade\nmyself that he had gone out of his way to meet it.",
        "The matter passed,\nhowever, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of\nsome \u00a3 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d Holmes interposed, \u201cyour statement is, I foresee, one of\nthe most remarkable to which I have ever listened.",
        "Let me have the date\nof the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his\nsupposed suicide.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe letter arrived on March 10, 1883.",
        "His death was seven weeks later,\nupon the night of May 2nd.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.",
        "Pray proceed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made\na careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up.",
        "We\nfound the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed.",
        "On\nthe inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.\nK. repeated upon it, and \u2018Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register\u2019\nwritten beneath.",
        "These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers\nwhich had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw.",
        "For the rest, there was\nnothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered\npapers and note-books bearing upon my uncle\u2019s life in America.",
        "Some of\nthem were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and\nhad borne the repute of a brave soldier.",
        "Others were of a date during\nthe reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned\nwith politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the\ncarpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.",
        "\u201cWell, it was the beginning of \u201984 when my father came to live at\nHorsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of\n\u201985.",
        "On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a\nsharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table.",
        "There\nhe was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried\norange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one.",
        "He had always\nlaughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but\nhe looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon\nhimself.",
        "\u201c\u2018Why, what on earth does this mean, John?\u2019 he stammered.",
        "\u201cMy heart had turned to lead.",
        "\u2018It is K. K. K.,\u2019 said I.",
        "\u201cHe looked inside the envelope.",
        "\u2018So it is,\u2019 he cried.",
        "\u2018Here are the\nvery letters.",
        "But what is this written above them?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Put the papers on the sundial,\u2019 I read, peeping over his shoulder.",
        "\u201c\u2018What papers?",
        "What sundial?\u2019 he asked.",
        "\u201c\u2018The sundial in the garden.",
        "There is no other,\u2019 said I; \u2018but the\npapers must be those that are destroyed.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Pooh!\u2019 said he, gripping hard at his courage.",
        "\u2018We are in a civilised\nland here, and we can\u2019t have tomfoolery of this kind.",
        "Where does the\nthing come from?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018From Dundee,\u2019 I answered, glancing at the postmark.",
        "\u201c\u2018Some preposterous practical joke,\u2019 said he.",
        "\u2018What have I to do with\nsundials and papers?",
        "I shall take no notice of such nonsense.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I should certainly speak to the police,\u2019 I said.",
        "\u201c\u2018And be laughed at for my pains.",
        "Nothing of the sort.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Then let me do so?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No, I forbid you.",
        "I won\u2019t have a fuss made about such nonsense.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man.",
        "I\nwent about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.",
        "\u201cOn the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from\nhome to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command\nof one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill.",
        "I was glad that he should go,\nfor it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away\nfrom home.",
        "In that, however, I was in error.",
        "Upon the second day of his\nabsence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at\nonce.",
        "My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound\nin the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull.",
        "I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his\nconsciousness.",
        "He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in\nthe twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit\nunfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of \u2018death\nfrom accidental causes.\u2019 Carefully as I examined every fact connected\nwith his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the\nidea of murder.",
        "There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no\nrobbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads.",
        "And\nyet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I\nwas well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.",
        "\u201cIn this sinister way I came into my inheritance.",
        "You will ask me why I\ndid not dispose of it?",
        "I answer, because I was well convinced that our\ntroubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle\u2019s\nlife, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in\nanother.",
        "\u201cIt was in January, \u201985, that my poor father met his end, and two years\nand eight months have elapsed since then.",
        "During that time I have lived\nhappily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed\naway from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation.",
        "I\nhad begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow\nfell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.\u201d\n\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning\nto the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.",
        "\u201cThis is the envelope,\u201d he continued.",
        "\u201cThe postmark is London\u2014eastern\ndivision.",
        "Within are the very words which were upon my father\u2019s last\nmessage: \u2018K.",
        "K. K.\u2019; and then \u2018Put the papers on the sundial.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d asked Holmes.",
        "\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo tell the truth\u201d\u2014he sank his face into his thin, white hands\u2014\u201cI have\nfelt helpless.",
        "I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the\nsnake is writhing towards it.",
        "I seem to be in the grasp of some\nresistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can\nguard against.\u201d\n\n\u201cTut!",
        "tut!\u201d cried Sherlock Holmes.",
        "\u201cYou must act, man, or you are lost.",
        "Nothing but energy can save you.",
        "This is no time for despair.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have seen the police.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they listened to my story with a smile.",
        "I am convinced that the\ninspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical\njokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as\nthe jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.\u201d\n\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air.",
        "\u201cIncredible imbecility!\u201d he\ncried.",
        "\u201cThey have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the\nhouse with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas he come with you to-night?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
        "His orders were to stay in the house.\u201d\n\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.",
        "\u201cWhy did you come to me?\u201d he said, \u201cand, above all, why did you not\ncome at once?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not know.",
        "It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast\nabout my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is really two days since you had the letter.",
        "We should have acted\nbefore this.",
        "You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which\nyou have placed before us\u2014no suggestive detail which might help us?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is one thing,\u201d said John Openshaw.",
        "He rummaged in his coat\npocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he\nlaid it out upon the table.",
        "\u201cI have some remembrance,\u201d said he, \u201cthat\non the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small,\nunburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular\ncolour.",
        "I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am\ninclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,\nfluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped\ndestruction.",
        "Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us\nmuch.",
        "I think myself that it is a page from some private diary.",
        "The\nwriting is undoubtedly my uncle\u2019s.\u201d\n\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which\nshowed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book.",
        "It\nwas headed, \u201cMarch, 1869,\u201d and beneath were the following enigmatical\nnotices:\n\n\u201c4th.",
        "Hudson came.",
        "Same old platform.",
        "\u201c7th.",
        "Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain of St.",
        "Augustine.",
        "\u201c9th.",
        "McCauley cleared.",
        "\u201c10th.",
        "John Swain cleared.",
        "\u201c12th.",
        "Visited Paramore.",
        "All well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our\nvisitor.",
        "\u201cAnd now you must on no account lose another instant.",
        "We\ncannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me.",
        "You must get\nhome instantly and act.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is but one thing to do.",
        "It must be done at once.",
        "You must put\nthis piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which\nyou have described.",
        "You must also put in a note to say that all the\nother papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one\nwhich remains.",
        "You must assert that in such words as will carry\nconviction with them.",
        "Having done this, you must at once put the box\nout upon the sundial, as directed.",
        "Do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cEntirely.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present.",
        "I think\nthat we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to\nweave, while theirs is already woven.",
        "The first consideration is to\nremove the pressing danger which threatens you.",
        "The second is to clear\nup the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank you,\u201d said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat.",
        "\u201cYou have given me fresh life and hope.",
        "I shall certainly do as you\nadvise.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not lose an instant.",
        "And, above all, take care of yourself in the\nmeanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are\nthreatened by a very real and imminent danger.",
        "How do you go back?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy train from Waterloo.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not yet nine.",
        "The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you\nmay be in safety.",
        "And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am armed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is well.",
        "To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall see you at Horsham, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, your secret lies in London.",
        "It is there that I shall seek it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to\nthe box and the papers.",
        "I shall take your advice in every particular.\u201d\nHe shook hands with us and took his leave.",
        "Outside the wind still\nscreamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows.",
        "This\nstrange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad\nelements\u2014blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale\u2014and now to\nhave been reabsorbed by them once more.",
        "Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk\nforward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire.",
        "Then he lit\nhis pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings\nas they chased each other up to the ceiling.",
        "\u201cI think, Watson,\u201d he remarked at last, \u201cthat of all our cases we have\nhad none more fantastic than this.\u201d\n\n\u201cSave, perhaps, the Sign of Four.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes.",
        "Save, perhaps, that.",
        "And yet this John Openshaw seems to me\nto be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut have you,\u201d I asked, \u201cformed any definite conception as to what\nthese perils are?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere can be no question as to their nature,\u201d he answered.",
        "\u201cThen what are they?",
        "Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this\nunhappy family?\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of\nhis chair, with his finger-tips together.",
        "\u201cThe ideal reasoner,\u201d he\nremarked, \u201cwould, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its\nbearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up\nto it but also all the results which would follow from it.",
        "As Cuvier\ncould correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a\nsingle bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in\na series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other\nones, both before and after.",
        "We have not yet grasped the results which\nthe reason alone can attain to.",
        "Problems may be solved in the study\nwhich have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of\ntheir senses.",
        "To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is\nnecessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts\nwhich have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you\nwill readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these\ndays of free education and encyclop\u00e6dias, is a somewhat rare\naccomplishment.",
        "It is not so impossible, however, that a man should\npossess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,\nand this I have endeavoured in my case to do.",
        "If I remember rightly,\nyou on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my\nlimits in a very precise fashion.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answered, laughing.",
        "\u201cIt was a singular document.",
        "Philosophy,\nastronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember.",
        "Botany\nvariable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region\nwithin fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic,\nsensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer,\nswordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco.",
        "Those, I\nthink, were the main points of my analysis.\u201d\n\nHolmes grinned at the last item.",
        "\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI say now, as I said\nthen, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all\nthe furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in\nthe lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it.",
        "Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us\nto-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources.",
        "Kindly hand me\ndown the letter K of the _American Encyclop\u00e6dia_ which stands upon the\nshelf beside you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Now let us consider the situation and see\nwhat may be deduced from it.",
        "In the first place, we may start with a\nstrong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason\nfor leaving America.",
        "Men at his time of life do not change all their\nhabits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the\nlonely life of an English provincial town.",
        "His extreme love of solitude\nin England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or\nsomething, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of\nsomeone or something which drove him from America.",
        "As to what it was he\nfeared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters\nwhich were received by himself and his successors.",
        "Did you remark the\npostmarks of those letters?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third\nfrom London.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom East London.",
        "What do you deduce from that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are all seaports.",
        "That the writer was on board of a ship.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent.",
        "We have already a clue.",
        "There can be no doubt that the\nprobability\u2014the strong probability\u2014is that the writer was on board of a\nship.",
        "And now let us consider another point.",
        "In the case of\nPondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,\nin Dundee it was only some three or four days.",
        "Does that suggest\nanything?\u201d\n\n\u201cA greater distance to travel.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the letter had also a greater distance to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I do not see the point.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or\nmen are is a sailing-ship.",
        "It looks as if they always send their\nsingular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.",
        "You see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from\nDundee.",
        "If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have\narrived almost as soon as their letter.",
        "But, as a matter of fact, seven\nweeks elapsed.",
        "I think that those seven weeks represented the\ndifference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the\nsailing vessel which brought the writer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore than that.",
        "It is probable.",
        "And now you see the deadly urgency of\nthis new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution.",
        "The blow has\nalways fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to\ntravel the distance.",
        "But this one comes from London, and therefore we\ncannot count upon delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood God!\u201d I cried.",
        "\u201cWhat can it mean, this relentless persecution?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to\nthe person or persons in the sailing-ship.",
        "I think that it is quite\nclear that there must be more than one of them.",
        "A single man could not\nhave carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner\u2019s\njury.",
        "There must have been several in it, and they must have been men\nof resource and determination.",
        "Their papers they mean to have, be the\nholder of them who it may.",
        "In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be\nthe initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut of what society?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you never\u2014\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking his\nvoice\u2014\u201chave you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never have.\u201d\n\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee.",

        "A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the\nsound produced by cocking a rifle.",
        "This terrible secret society was\nformed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the\nCivil War, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of\nthe country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia,\nand Florida.",
        "Its power was used for political purposes, principally for\nthe terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from\nthe country of those who were opposed to its views.",
        "Its outrages were\nusually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic\nbut generally recognised shape\u2014a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts,\nmelon seeds or orange pips in others.",
        "On receiving this the victim\nmight either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the\ncountry.",
        "If he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon\nhim, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner.",
        "So perfect was\nthe organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that\nthere is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving\nit with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to\nthe perpetrators.",
        "For some years the organisation flourished in spite\nof the efforts of the United States government and of the better\nclasses of the community in the South.",
        "Eventually, in the year 1869,\nthe movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been\nsporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou will observe,\u201d said Holmes, laying down the volume, \u201cthat the\nsudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance\nof Openshaw from America with their papers.",
        "It may well have been cause\nand effect.",
        "It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the\nmore implacable spirits upon their track.",
        "You can understand that this\nregister and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South,\nand that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is\nrecovered.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen the page we have seen\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIs such as we might expect.",
        "It ran, if I remember right, \u2018sent the\npips to A, B, and C\u2019\u2014that is, sent the society\u2019s warning to them.",
        "Then\nthere are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the country,\nand finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister result for C.\nWell, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place,\nand I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime\nis to do what I have told him.",
        "There is nothing more to be said or to\nbe done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget\nfor half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable\nways of our fellow men.\u201d\n\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued\nbrightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.",

        "The alarm, however, was given, and, by\nthe aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered.",
        "It\nproved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from\nan envelope which was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose\nresidence is near Horsham.",
        "It is conjectured that he may have been\nhurrying down to catch the last train from Waterloo Station, and that\nin his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked\nover the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats.",
        "The body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt\nthat the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which\nshould have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to\nthe condition of the riverside landing-stages.\u2019\u201d\n\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken\nthan I had ever seen him.",

        "I shall have the others, but he first.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you trace it, then?\u201d\n\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates\nand names.",

        "He had turned his back so that none could see him but I.\nHis form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had\nregained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my\nsurprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes.",
        "He made a slight motion\nto me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round\nto the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped\nsenility.",
        "\u201cHolmes!\u201d I whispered, \u201cwhat on earth are you doing in this den?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs low as you can,\u201d he answered; \u201cI have excellent ears.",
        "If you would\nhave the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I\nshould be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a cab outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen pray send him home in it.",
        "You may safely trust him, for he\nappears to be too limp to get into any mischief.",
        "I should recommend you\nalso to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have\nthrown in your lot with me.",
        "If you will wait outside, I shall be with\nyou in five minutes.\u201d\n\nIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes\u2019 requests, for they\nwere always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet\nair of mastery.",
        "I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in\nthe cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I\ncould not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in\none of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his\nexistence.",
        "In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney\u2019s bill,\nled him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness.",
        "In a\nvery short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and I\nwas walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes.",
        "For two streets he\nshuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot.",
        "Then, glancing\nquickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit\nof laughter.",
        "\u201cI suppose, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you imagine that I have added\nopium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little\nweaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was certainly surprised to find you there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut not more so than I to find you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to find a friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I to find an enemy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn enemy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.",
        "Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I\nhave hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as\nI have done before now.",
        "Had I been recognised in that den my life would\nnot have been worth an hour\u2019s purchase; for I have used it before now\nfor my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to\nhave vengeance upon me.",
        "There is a trap-door at the back of that\nbuilding, near the corner of Paul\u2019s Wharf, which could tell some\nstrange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!",
        "You do not mean bodies?\u201d\n\n\u201cAy, bodies, Watson.",
        "We should be rich men if we had \u00a3 1000 for every\npoor devil who has been done to death in that den.",
        "It is the vilest\nmurder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that Neville St.",
        "Clair\nhas entered it never to leave it more.",
        "But our trap should be here.\u201d He\nput his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly\u2014a signal\nwhich was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed\nshortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses\u2019 hoofs.",
        "\u201cNow, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the\ngloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side\nlanterns.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019ll come with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I can be of use.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.",
        "My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Cedars?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; that is Mr.",
        "St.",
        "Clair\u2019s house.",
        "I am staying there while I conduct\nthe inquiry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is it, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cNear Lee, in Kent.",
        "We have a seven-mile drive before us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am all in the dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course you are.",
        "You\u2019ll know all about it presently.",
        "Jump up here.",
        "All right, John; we shall not need you.",
        "Here\u2019s half a crown.",
        "Look out\nfor me to-morrow, about eleven.",
        "Give her her head.",
        "So long, then!\u201d\n\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the\nendless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened\ngradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with\nthe murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us.",
        "Beyond lay another dull\nwilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,\nregular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some\nbelated party of revellers.",
        "A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the\nsky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts\nof the clouds.",
        "Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his\nbreast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside\nhim, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax\nhis powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of\nhis thoughts.",
        "We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to\nthe fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,\nshrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who\nhas satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.",
        "\u201cYou have a grand gift of silence, Watson,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cIt makes you\nquite invaluable as a companion.",
        "\u2019Pon my word, it is a great thing for\nme to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not\nover-pleasant.",
        "I was wondering what I should say to this dear little\nwoman to-night when she meets me at the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou forget that I know nothing about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get\nto Lee.",
        "It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can get nothing to\ngo upon.",
        "There\u2019s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can\u2019t get the end of\nit into my hand.",
        "Now, I\u2019ll state the case clearly and concisely to you,\nWatson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cProceed, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome years ago\u2014to be definite, in May, 1884\u2014there came to Lee a\ngentleman, Neville St.",
        "Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of\nmoney.",
        "He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and\nlived generally in good style.",
        "By degrees he made friends in the\nneighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer,\nby whom he now has two children.",
        "He had no occupation, but was\ninterested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the\nmorning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon Street every night.",
        "Mr.",
        "St.",
        "Clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a\ngood husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with\nall who know him.",
        "I may add that his whole debts at the present moment,\nas far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to \u00a3 88 10_s_., while\nhe has \u00a3 220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.",
        "There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been\nweighing upon his mind.",
        "\u201cLast Monday Mr.",
        "Neville St.",
        "Clair went into town rather earlier than\nusual, remarking before he started that he had two important\ncommissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a\nbox of bricks.",
        "Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram\nupon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect\nthat a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting\nwas waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.",
        "Now, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the office\nof the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam\nLane, where you found me to-night.",
        "Mrs.",
        "St.",
        "Clair had her lunch,\nstarted for the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company\u2019s\noffice, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking\nthrough Swandam Lane on her way back to the station.",
        "Have you followed\nme so far?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs.",
        "St.",
        "Clair\nwalked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did\nnot like the neighbourhood in which she found herself.",
        "While she was\nwalking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an\nejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down\nat her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor\nwindow.",
        "The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she\ndescribes as being terribly agitated.",
        "He waved his hands frantically to\nher, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to\nher that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from\nbehind.",
        "One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that\nalthough he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he\nhad on neither collar nor necktie.",
        "\u201cConvinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the\nsteps\u2014for the house was none other than the opium den in which you\nfound me to-night\u2014and running through the front room she attempted to\nascend the stairs which led to the first floor.",
        "At the foot of the\nstairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken,\nwho thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there,\npushed her out into the street.",
        "Filled with the most maddening doubts\nand fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in\nFresno Street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their\nway to their beat.",
        "The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and\nin spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their\nway to the room in which Mr.",
        "St.",
        "Clair had last been seen.",
        "There was no\nsign of him there.",
        "In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one\nto be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,\nmade his home there.",
        "Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one\nelse had been in the front room during the afternoon.",
        "So determined was\ntheir denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to\nbelieve that Mrs.",
        "St.",
        "Clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she\nsprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid\nfrom it.",
        "Out there fell a cascade of children\u2019s bricks.",
        "It was the toy\nwhich he had promised to bring home.",
        "\u201cThis discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,\nmade the inspector realise that the matter was serious.",
        "The rooms were\ncarefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime.",
        "The\nfront room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small\nbedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves.",
        "Between\nthe wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low\ntide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of\nwater.",
        "The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below.",
        "On\nexamination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and\nseveral scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the\nbedroom.",
        "Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the\nclothes of Mr.",
        "Neville St.",
        "Clair, with the exception of his coat.",
        "His\nboots, his socks, his hat, and his watch\u2014all were there.",
        "There were no\nsigns of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other\ntraces of Mr.",
        "Neville St.",
        "Clair.",
        "Out of the window he must apparently\nhave gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous\nbloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save\nhimself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment\nof the tragedy.",
        "\u201cAnd now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in\nthe matter.",
        "The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents,\nbut as, by Mrs.",
        "St.",
        "Clair\u2019s story, he was known to have been at the\nfoot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband\u2019s appearance\nat the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the\ncrime.",
        "His defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that\nhe had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and\nthat he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing\ngentleman\u2019s clothes.",
        "\u201cSo much for the Lascar manager.",
        "Now for the sinister cripple who lives\nupon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last\nhuman being whose eyes rested upon Neville St.",
        "Clair.",
        "His name is Hugh\nBoone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who\ngoes much to the City.",
        "He is a professional beggar, though in order to\navoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax\nvestas.",
        "Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the\nleft-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in\nthe wall.",
        "Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,\ncross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a\npiteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy\nleather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him.",
        "I have watched the\nfellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional\nacquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has\nreaped in a short time.",
        "His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that\nno one can pass him without observing him.",
        "A shock of orange hair, a\npale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has\nturned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair\nof very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the\ncolour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of\nmendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply\nto any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by.",
        "This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium\nden, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are\nin quest.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut a cripple!\u201d said I.",
        "\u201cWhat could he have done single-handed against\na man in the prime of life?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other\nrespects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.",
        "Surely your\nmedical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is\noften compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cPray continue your narrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs.",
        "St.",
        "Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,\nand she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could\nbe of no help to them in their investigations.",
        "Inspector Barton, who\nhad charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the\npremises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the\nmatter.",
        "One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as\nhe was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated\nwith his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he\nwas seized and searched, without anything being found which could\nincriminate him.",
        "There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his\nright shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been\ncut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there,\nadding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the\nstains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same\nsource.",
        "He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr.",
        "Neville St.",
        "Clair\nand swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a\nmystery to him as to the police.",
        "As to Mrs.",
        "St.",
        "Clair\u2019s assertion that\nshe had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she\nmust have been either mad or dreaming.",
        "He was removed, loudly\nprotesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon\nthe premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh\nclue.",
        "\u201cAnd it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had\nfeared to find.",
        "It was Neville St.",
        "Clair\u2019s coat, and not Neville St.",
        "Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded.",
        "And what do you think\nthey found in the pockets?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot imagine.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you would guess.",
        "Every pocket stuffed with pennies\nand half-pennies\u2014421 pennies and 270 half-pennies.",
        "It was no wonder\nthat it had not been swept away by the tide.",
        "But a human body is a\ndifferent matter.",
        "There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the\nhouse.",
        "It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when\nthe stripped body had been sucked away into the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.",
        "Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough.",
        "Suppose that\nthis man Boone had thrust Neville St.",
        "Clair through the window, there\nis no human eye which could have seen the deed.",
        "What would he do then?",
        "It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the\ntell-tale garments.",
        "He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of\nthrowing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not\nsink.",
        "He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when\nthe wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard\nfrom his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.",
        "There is not an instant to be lost.",
        "He rushes to some secret hoard,\nwhere he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all\nthe coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure\nof the coat\u2019s sinking.",
        "He throws it out, and would have done the same\nwith the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and\nonly just had time to close the window when the police appeared.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt certainly sounds feasible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.",
        "Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but\nit could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against\nhim.",
        "He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life\nappeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one.",
        "There the matter\nstands at present, and the questions which have to be solved\u2014what\nNeville St.",
        "Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when\nthere, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his\ndisappearance\u2014are all as far from a solution as ever.",
        "I confess that I\ncannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first\nglance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.\u201d\n\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of\nevents, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town\nuntil the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled\nalong with a country hedge upon either side of us.",
        "Just as he finished,\nhowever, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights\nstill glimmered in the windows.",
        "\u201cWe are on the outskirts of Lee,\u201d said my companion.",
        "\u201cWe have touched\non three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex,\npassing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.",
        "See that light\namong the trees?",
        "That is The Cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman\nwhose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the clink\nof our horse\u2019s feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?\u201d I asked.",
        "\u201cBecause there are many inquiries which must be made out here.",
        "Mrs.",
        "St.",
        "Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest\nassured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and\ncolleague.",
        "I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her\nhusband.",
        "Here we are.",
        "Whoa, there, whoa!\u201d\n\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own\ngrounds.",
        "A stable-boy had run out to the horse\u2019s head, and springing\ndown, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to\nthe house.",
        "As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde\nwoman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de\nsoie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists.",
        "She\nstood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand\nupon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly\nbent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a\nstanding question.",
        "\u201cWell?\u201d she cried, \u201cwell?\u201d And then, seeing that there were two of us,\nshe gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my\ncompanion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.",
        "\u201cNo good news?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo bad?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank God for that.",

        "You must be weary, for you have had a\nlong day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is my friend, Dr.",
        "Watson.",
        "He has been of most vital use to me in\nseveral of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to\nbring him out and associate him with this investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am delighted to see you,\u201d said she, pressing my hand warmly.",
        "\u201cYou\nwill, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our\narrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly\nupon us.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear madam,\u201d said I, \u201cI am an old campaigner, and if I were not I\ncan very well see that no apology is needed.",
        "If I can be of any\nassistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed\nhappy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, Mr.",
        "Sherlock Holmes,\u201d said the lady as we entered a well-lit\ndining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out,\n\u201cI should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to\nwhich I beg that you will give a plain answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, madam.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not trouble about my feelings.",
        "I am not hysterical, nor given to\nfainting.",
        "I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cUpon what point?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question.",
        "\u201cFrankly,\nnow!\u201d she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at\nhim as he leaned back in a basket-chair.",
        "\u201cFrankly, then, madam, I do not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think that he is dead?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u201cMurdered?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t say that.",
        "Perhaps.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd on what day did he meet his death?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Monday.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen perhaps, Mr.",
        "Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is\nthat I have received a letter from him to-day.\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.",
        "\u201cWhat!\u201d he roared.",
        "\u201cYes, to-day.\u201d She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in\nthe air.",
        "\u201cMay I see it?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the\ntable he drew over the lamp and examined it intently.",
        "I had left my\nchair and was gazing at it over his shoulder.",
        "The envelope was a very\ncoarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the\ndate of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was\nconsiderably after midnight.",
        "\u201cCoarse writing,\u201d murmured Holmes.",
        "\u201cSurely this is not your husband\u2019s\nwriting, madam.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but the enclosure is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and\ninquire as to the address.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you tell that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.",
        "The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has\nbeen used.",
        "If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none\nwould be of a deep black shade.",
        "This man has written the name, and\nthere has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only\nmean that he was not familiar with it.",
        "It is, of course, a trifle, but\nthere is nothing so important as trifles.",
        "Let us now see the letter.",
        "Ha!",
        "there has been an enclosure here!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, there was a ring.",
        "His signet-ring.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you are sure that this is your husband\u2019s hand?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of his hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne?\u201d\n\n\u201cHis hand when he wrote hurriedly.",
        "It is very unlike his usual writing,\nand yet I know it well.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Dearest do not be frightened.",
        "All will come well.",
        "There is a huge\nerror which it may take some little time to rectify.",
        "Wait in\npatience.\u2014NEVILLE.\u2019 Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book,\noctavo size, no water-mark.",
        "Hum!",
        "Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man\nwith a dirty thumb.",
        "Ha!",
        "And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very\nmuch in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco.",
        "And you have\nno doubt that it is your husband\u2019s hand, madam?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone.",
        "Neville wrote those words.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they were posted to-day at Gravesend.",
        "Well, Mrs.",
        "St.",
        "Clair, the\nclouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is\nover.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he must be alive, Mr.",
        "Holmes.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.",
        "The\nring, after all, proves nothing.",
        "It may have been taken from him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no; it is, it is his very own writing!\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well.",
        "It may, however, have been written on Monday and only\nposted to-day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf so, much may have happened between.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you must not discourage me, Mr.",
        "Holmes.",
        "I know that all is well\nwith him.",
        "There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if\nevil came upon him.",
        "On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself\nin the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly\nwith the utmost certainty that something had happened.",
        "Do you think\nthat I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his\ndeath?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be\nmore valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner.",
        "And in\nthis letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to\ncorroborate your view.",
        "But if your husband is alive and able to write\nletters, why should he remain away from you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot imagine.",
        "It is unthinkable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery much so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas the window open?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he might have called to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe might.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cA call for help, you thought?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
        "He waved his hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it might have been a cry of surprise.",
        "Astonishment at the\nunexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you thought he was pulled back?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe disappeared so suddenly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe might have leaped back.",
        "You did not see anyone else in the room?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the\nLascar was at the foot of the stairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so.",
        "Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary\nclothes on?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut without his collar or tie.",
        "I distinctly saw his bare throat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Mrs.",
        "St.",
        "Clair.",
        "Those are the principal points about which\nI wished to be absolutely clear.",
        "We shall now have a little supper and\nthen retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.\u201d\n\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our\ndisposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after\nmy night of adventure.",
        "Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he\nhad an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for\na week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking\nat it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or\nconvinced himself that his data were insufficient.",
        "It was soon evident\nto me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting.",
        "He took off\nhis coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then\nwandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions\nfrom the sofa and armchairs.",
        "With these he constructed a sort of\nEastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an\nounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him.",
        "In\nthe dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe\nbetween his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the\nceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with\nthe light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features.",
        "So he sat as I\ndropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me\nto wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment.",
        "The\npipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the\nroom was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap\nof shag which I had seen upon the previous night.",
        "\u201cAwake, Watson?\u201d he asked.",
        "\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cGame for a morning drive?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen dress.",
        "No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy\nsleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.\u201d He chuckled to himself as\nhe spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the\nsombre thinker of the previous night.",
        "As I dressed I glanced at my watch.",
        "It was no wonder that no one was\nstirring.",
        "It was twenty-five minutes past four.",
        "I had hardly finished\nwhen Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the\nhorse.",
        "\u201cI want to test a little theory of mine,\u201d said he, pulling on his\nboots.",
        "\u201cI think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of\none of the most absolute fools in Europe.",
        "I deserve to be kicked from\nhere to Charing Cross.",
        "But I think I have the key of the affair now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd where is it?\u201d I asked, smiling.",
        "\u201cIn the bathroom,\u201d he answered.",
        "\u201cOh, yes, I am not joking,\u201d he\ncontinued, seeing my look of incredulity.",
        "\u201cI have just been there, and\nI have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag.",
        "Come on,\nmy boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.\u201d\n\nWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the\nbright morning sunshine.",
        "In the road stood our horse and trap, with the\nhalf-clad stable-boy waiting at the head.",
        "We both sprang in, and away\nwe dashed down the London Road.",
        "A few country carts were stirring,\nbearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on\neither side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.",
        "\u201cIt has been in some points a singular case,\u201d said Holmes, flicking the\nhorse on into a gallop.",
        "\u201cI confess that I have been as blind as a mole,\nbut it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.\u201d\n\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from\ntheir windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.",
        "Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and\ndashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found\nourselves in Bow Street.",
        "Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force,\nand the two constables at the door saluted him.",
        "One of them held the\nhorse\u2019s head while the other led us in.",
        "\u201cWho is on duty?\u201d asked Holmes.",
        "\u201cInspector Bradstreet, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, Bradstreet, how are you?\u201d A tall, stout official had come down the\nstone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket.",
        "\u201cI wish to\nhave a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, Mr.",
        "Holmes.",
        "Step into my room here.\u201d\n\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table,\nand a telephone projecting from the wall.",
        "The inspector sat down at his\ndesk.",
        "\u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr.",
        "Holmes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI called about that beggarman, Boone\u2014the one who was charged with\nbeing concerned in the disappearance of Mr.",
        "Neville St.",
        "Clair, of Lee.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
        "He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I heard.",
        "You have him here?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the cells.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he quiet?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, he gives no trouble.",
        "But he is a dirty scoundrel.\u201d\n\n\u201cDirty?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is\nas black as a tinker\u2019s.",
        "Well, when once his case has been settled, he\nwill have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would\nagree with me that he needed it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should like to see him very much.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you?",
        "That is easily done.",
        "Come this way.",
        "You can leave your\nbag.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I think that I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good.",
        "Come this way, if you please.\u201d He led us down a passage,\nopened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a\nwhitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.",
        "\u201cThe third on the right is his,\u201d said the inspector.",
        "\u201cHere it is!\u201d He\nquietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced\nthrough.",
        "\u201cHe is asleep,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cYou can see him very well.\u201d\n\nWe both put our eyes to the grating.",
        "The prisoner lay with his face\ntowards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily.",
        "He was\na middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a\ncoloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat.",
        "He\nwas, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which\ncovered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness.",
        "A broad\nwheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its\ncontraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three\nteeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl.",
        "A shock of very bright red\nhair grew low over his eyes and forehead.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s a beauty, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said the inspector.",
        "\u201cHe certainly needs a wash,\u201d remarked Holmes.",
        "\u201cI had an idea that he\nmight, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.\u201d He opened\nthe Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very\nlarge bath-sponge.",
        "\u201cHe!",
        "he!",
        "You are a funny one,\u201d chuckled the inspector.",
        "\u201cNow, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very\nquietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know why not,\u201d said the inspector.",
        "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look a\ncredit to the Bow Street cells, does he?\u201d He slipped his key into the\nlock, and we all very quietly entered the cell.",
        "The sleeper half\nturned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber.",
        "Holmes\nstooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it\ntwice vigorously across and down the prisoner\u2019s face.",
        "\u201cLet me introduce you,\u201d he shouted, \u201cto Mr.",
        "Neville St.",
        "Clair, of Lee,\nin the county of Kent.\u201d\n\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight.",
        "The man\u2019s face peeled off\nunder the sponge like the bark from a tree.",
        "Gone was the coarse brown\ntint!",
        "Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and\nthe twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face!",
        "A\ntwitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his\nbed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and\nsmooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy\nbewilderment.",
        "Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a\nscream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.",
        "\u201cGreat heavens!\u201d cried the inspector, \u201cit is, indeed, the missing man.",
        "I know him from the photograph.\u201d\n\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself\nto his destiny.",
        "\u201cBe it so,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cAnd pray what am I charged with?\u201d\n\n\u201cWith making away with Mr.",
        "Neville St.\u2014 Oh, come, you can\u2019t be charged\nwith that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,\u201d said the\ninspector with a grin.",
        "\u201cWell, I have been twenty-seven years in the\nforce, but this really takes the cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I am Mr.",
        "Neville St.",
        "Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has\nbeen committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo crime, but a very great error has been committed,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cYou would have done better to have trusted your wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not the wife; it was the children,\u201d groaned the prisoner.",
        "\u201cGod\nhelp me, I would not have them ashamed of their father.",
        "My God!",
        "What an\nexposure!",
        "What can I do?\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly\non the shoulder.",
        "\u201cIf you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,\u201d said he,\n\u201cof course you can hardly avoid publicity.",
        "On the other hand, if you\nconvince the police authorities that there is no possible case against\nyou, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should\nfind their way into the papers.",
        "Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure,\nmake notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the\nproper authorities.",
        "The case would then never go into court at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod bless you!\u201d cried the prisoner passionately.",
        "\u201cI would have endured\nimprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable\nsecret as a family blot to my children.",
        "\u201cYou are the first who have ever heard my story.",
        "My father was a\nschoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education.",
        "I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a\nreporter on an evening paper in London.",
        "One day my editor wished to\nhave a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and I\nvolunteered to supply them.",
        "There was the point from which all my\nadventures started.",
        "It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I\ncould get the facts upon which to base my articles.",
        "When an actor I\nhad, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been\nfamous in the green-room for my skill.",
        "I took advantage now of my\nattainments.",
        "I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as\npossible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by\nthe aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster.",
        "Then with a red head\nof hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business\npart of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar.",
        "For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in the\nevening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26_s_.",
        "4_d_.",
        "\u201cI wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some\ntime later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me\nfor \u00a3 25.",
        "I was at my wit\u2019s end where to get the money, but a sudden\nidea came to me.",
        "I begged a fortnight\u2019s grace from the creditor, asked\nfor a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the\nCity under my disguise.",
        "In ten days I had the money and had paid the\ndebt.",
        "\u201cWell, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work\nat \u00a3 2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by\nsmearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and\nsitting still.",
        "It was a long fight between my pride and the money, but\nthe dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting and sat day after day\nin the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly\nface and filling my pockets with coppers.",
        "Only one man knew my secret.",
        "He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam\nLane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the\nevenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town.",
        "This\nfellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew\nthat my secret was safe in his possession.",
        "\u201cWell, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.",
        "I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn \u00a3 700\na year\u2014which is less than my average takings\u2014but I had exceptional\nadvantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of\nrepartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised\ncharacter in the City.",
        "All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,\npoured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take\n\u00a3 2.",
        "\u201cAs I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,\nand eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real\noccupation.",
        "My dear wife knew that I had business in the City.",
        "She\nlittle knew what.",
        "\u201cLast Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room\nabove the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my\nhorror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with\nher eyes fixed full upon me.",
        "I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms\nto cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated\nhim to prevent anyone from coming up to me.",
        "I heard her voice\ndownstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend.",
        "Swiftly I threw off\nmy clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and\nwig.",
        "Even a wife\u2019s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise.",
        "But\nthen it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and\nthat the clothes might betray me.",
        "I threw open the window, reopening by\nmy violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the\nbedroom that morning.",
        "Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the\ncoppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in\nwhich I carried my takings.",
        "I hurled it out of the window, and it\ndisappeared into the Thames.",
        "The other clothes would have followed, but\nat that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few\nminutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of\nbeing identified as Mr.",
        "Neville St.",
        "Clair, I was arrested as his\nmurderer.",
        "\u201cI do not know that there is anything else for me to explain.",
        "I was\ndetermined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my\npreference for a dirty face.",
        "Knowing that my wife would be terribly\nanxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a\nmoment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried\nscrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat note only reached her yesterday,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cGood God!",
        "What a week she must have spent!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe police have watched this Lascar,\u201d said Inspector Bradstreet, \u201cand\nI can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter\nunobserved.",
        "Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who\nforgot all about it for some days.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was it,\u201d said Holmes, nodding approvingly; \u201cI have no doubt of\nit.",
        "But have you never been prosecuted for begging?\u201d\n\n\u201cMany times; but what was a fine to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must stop here, however,\u201d said Bradstreet.",
        "\u201cIf the police are to\nhush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be\ntaken.",
        "But if you are found again, then all must come out.",
        "I am sure,\nMr.",
        "Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared\nthe matter up.",
        "I wish I knew how you reach your results.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reached this one,\u201d said my friend, \u201cby sitting upon five pillows and\nconsuming an ounce of shag.",
        "I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker\nStreet we shall just be in time for breakfast.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nVII.",
        "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE\n\n\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning\nafter Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of\nthe season.",
        "He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a\npipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled\nmorning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand.",
        "Beside the couch\nwas a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and\ndisreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in\nseveral places.",
        "A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair\nsuggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the\npurpose of examination.",
        "\u201cYou are engaged,\u201d said I; \u201cperhaps I interrupt you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all.",
        "I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my\nresults.",
        "The matter is a perfectly trivial one\u201d\u2014he jerked his thumb in\nthe direction of the old hat\u2014\u201cbut there are points in connection with\nit which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.\u201d\n\nI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his\ncrackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were\nthick with the ice crystals.",
        "\u201cI suppose,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthat, homely as\nit looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it\u2014that it is\nthe clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the\npunishment of some crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no.",
        "No crime,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing.",
        "\u201cOnly one of those\nwhimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million\nhuman beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square\nmiles.",
        "Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity,\nevery possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and\nmany a little problem will be presented which may be striking and\nbizarre without being criminal.",
        "We have already had experience of\nsuch.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo much so,\u201d I remarked, \u201cthat of the last six cases which I have\nadded to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely.",
        "You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers,\nto the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of\nthe man with the twisted lip.",
        "Well, I have no doubt that this small\nmatter will fall into the same innocent category.",
        "You know Peterson,\nthe commissionaire?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is to him that this trophy belongs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is his hat.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, he found it.",
        "Its owner is unknown.",
        "I beg that you will look\nupon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem.",
        "And, first, as to how it came here.",
        "It arrived upon Christmas morning,\nin company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting\nat this moment in front of Peterson\u2019s fire.",
        "The facts are these: about\nfour o\u2019clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a\nvery honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was\nmaking his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road.",
        "In front of him he\nsaw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and\ncarrying a white goose slung over his shoulder.",
        "As he reached the\ncorner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a\nlittle knot of roughs.",
        "One of the latter knocked off the man\u2019s hat, on\nwhich he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his\nhead, smashed the shop window behind him.",
        "Peterson had rushed forward\nto protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at\nhaving broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in\nuniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and\nvanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of\nTottenham Court Road.",
        "The roughs had also fled at the appearance of\nPeterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and\nalso of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a\nmost unimpeachable Christmas goose.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich surely he restored to their owner?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow, there lies the problem.",
        "It is true that \u2018For Mrs.",
        "Henry Baker\u2019 was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird\u2019s\nleft leg, and it is also true that the initials \u2018H.",
        "B.\u2019 are legible\nupon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of Bakers,\nand some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy\nto restore lost property to any one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, then, did Peterson do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,\nknowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.",
        "The\ngoose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in\nspite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten\nwithout unnecessary delay.",
        "Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to\nfulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the\nhat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he not advertise?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, what clue could you have as to his identity?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly as much as we can deduce.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom his hat?\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you are joking.",
        "What can you gather from this old battered felt?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is my lens.",
        "You know my methods.",
        "What can you gather yourself as\nto the individuality of the man who has worn this article?\u201d\n\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather\nruefully.",
        "It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape,\nhard and much the worse for wear.",
        "The lining had been of red silk, but\nwas a good deal discoloured.",
        "There was no maker\u2019s name; but, as Holmes\nhad remarked, the initials \u201cH.",
        "B.\u201d were scrawled upon one side.",
        "It was\npierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing.",
        "For\nthe rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several\nplaces, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the\ndiscoloured patches by smearing them with ink.",
        "\u201cI can see nothing,\u201d said I, handing it back to my friend.",
        "\u201cOn the contrary, Watson, you can see everything.",
        "You fail, however, to\nreason from what you see.",
        "You are too timid in drawing your\ninferences.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?\u201d\n\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion\nwhich was characteristic of him.",
        "\u201cIt is perhaps less suggestive than it\nmight have been,\u201d he remarked, \u201cand yet there are a few inferences\nwhich are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a\nstrong balance of probability.",
        "That the man was highly intellectual is\nof course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly\nwell-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon\nevil days.",
        "He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing\nto a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his\nfortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at\nwork upon him.",
        "This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife\nhas ceased to love him.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,\u201d he continued,\ndisregarding my remonstrance.",
        "\u201cHe is a man who leads a sedentary life,\ngoes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has\ngrizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which\nhe anoints with lime-cream.",
        "These are the more patent facts which are\nto be deduced from his hat.",
        "Also, by the way, that it is extremely\nimprobable that he has gas laid on in his house.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are certainly joking, Holmes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in the least.",
        "Is it possible that even now, when I give you these\nresults, you are unable to see how they are attained?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am\nunable to follow you.",
        "For example, how did you deduce that this man was\nintellectual?\u201d\n\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head.",
        "It came right over the\nforehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose.",
        "\u201cIt is a question of\ncubic capacity,\u201d said he; \u201ca man with so large a brain must have\nsomething in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decline of his fortunes, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis hat is three years old.",
        "These flat brims curled at the edge came\nin then.",
        "It is a hat of the very best quality.",
        "Look at the band of\nribbed silk and the excellent lining.",
        "If this man could afford to buy\nso expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he\nhas assuredly gone down in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that is clear enough, certainly.",
        "But how about the foresight and\nthe moral retrogression?\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes laughed.",
        "\u201cHere is the foresight,\u201d said he putting his\nfinger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer.",
        "\u201cThey are\nnever sold upon hats.",
        "If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a\ncertain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this\nprecaution against the wind.",
        "But since we see that he has broken the\nelastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has\nless foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a\nweakening nature.",
        "On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some\nof these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign\nthat he has not entirely lost his self-respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour reasoning is certainly plausible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,\nthat it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to\nbe gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining.",
        "The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the\nscissors of the barber.",
        "They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a\ndistinct odour of lime-cream.",
        "This dust, you will observe, is not the\ngritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,\nshowing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the\nmarks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer\nperspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of\ntraining.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut his wife\u2014you said that she had ceased to love him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis hat has not been brushed for weeks.",
        "When I see you, my dear\nWatson, with a week\u2019s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your\nwife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also\nhave been unfortunate enough to lose your wife\u2019s affection.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he might be a bachelor.\u201d\n\n\u201cNay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.",
        "Remember the card upon the bird\u2019s leg.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have an answer to everything.",
        "But how on earth do you deduce that\nthe gas is not laid on in his house?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no\nless than five, I think that there can be little doubt that the\nindividual must be brought into frequent contact with burning\ntallow\u2014walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a\nguttering candle in the other.",
        "Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from\na gas-jet.",
        "Are you satisfied?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it is very ingenious,\u201d said I, laughing; \u201cbut since, as you said\njust now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the\nloss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open,\nand Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with\nflushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.",
        "\u201cThe goose, Mr.",
        "Holmes!",
        "The goose, sir!\u201d he gasped.",
        "\u201cEh?",
        "What of it, then?",
        "Has it returned to life and flapped off through\nthe kitchen window?\u201d Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get\na fairer view of the man\u2019s excited face.",
        "\u201cSee here, sir!",
        "See what my wife found in its crop!\u201d He held out his\nhand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly\nscintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of\nsuch purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the\ndark hollow of his hand.",
        "Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle.",
        "\u201cBy Jove, Peterson!\u201d said he,\n\u201cthis is treasure trove indeed.",
        "I suppose you know what you have got?\u201d\n\n\u201cA diamond, sir?",
        "A precious stone.",
        "It cuts into glass as though it were\nputty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than a precious stone.",
        "It is _the_ precious stone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the Countess of Morcar\u2019s blue carbuncle!\u201d I ejaculated.",
        "\u201cPrecisely so.",
        "I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have\nread the advertisement about it in _The Times_ every day lately.",
        "It is\nabsolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the\nreward offered of \u00a3 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of\nthe market price.\u201d\n\n\u201cA thousand pounds!",
        "Great Lord of mercy!\u201d The commissionaire plumped\ndown into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.",
        "\u201cThat is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are\nsentimental considerations in the background which would induce the\nCountess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the\ngem.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,\u201d I\nremarked.",
        "\u201cPrecisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago.",
        "John Horner, a\nplumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady\u2019s\njewel-case.",
        "The evidence against him was so strong that the case has\nbeen referred to the Assizes.",
        "I have some account of the matter here, I\nbelieve.\u201d He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates,\nuntil at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the\nfollowing paragraph:\n\n\u201cHotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery.",
        "John Horner, 26, plumber, was\nbrought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted\nfrom the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as\nthe blue carbuncle.",
        "James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his\nevidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room\nof the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he\nmight solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose.",
        "He had\nremained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called\naway.",
        "On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the\nbureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in\nwhich, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was accustomed to keep\nher jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table.",
        "Ryder instantly\ngave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone\ncould not be found either upon his person or in his rooms.",
        "Catherine\nCusack, maid to the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder\u2019s cry of\ndismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,\nwhere she found matters as described by the last witness.",
        "Inspector\nBradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who\nstruggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest\nterms.",
        "Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given\nagainst the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the\noffence, but referred it to the Assizes.",
        "Horner, who had shown signs of\nintense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion\nand was carried out of court.\u201d\n\n\u201cHum!",
        "So much for the police-court,\u201d said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing\naside the paper.",
        "\u201cThe question for us now to solve is the sequence of\nevents leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a\ngoose in Tottenham Court Road at the other.",
        "You see, Watson, our little\ndeductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less\ninnocent aspect.",
        "Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and\nthe goose came from Mr.",
        "Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and\nall the other characteristics with which I have bored you.",
        "So now we\nmust set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and\nascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery.",
        "To do\nthis, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly\nin an advertisement in all the evening papers.",
        "If this fail, I shall\nhave recourse to other methods.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me a pencil and that slip of paper.",
        "Now, then: \u2018Found at the\ncorner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat.",
        "Mr.",
        "Henry Baker\ncan have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker\nStreet.\u2019 That is clear and concise.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery.",
        "But will he see it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man,\nthe loss was a heavy one.",
        "He was clearly so scared by his mischance in\nbreaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of\nnothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the\nimpulse which caused him to drop his bird.",
        "Then, again, the\nintroduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who\nknows him will direct his attention to it.",
        "Here you are, Peterson, run\ndown to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening\npapers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn which, sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, in the _Globe_, _Star_, _Pall Mall_, _St.",
        "James\u2019s Gazette_,\n_Evening News_, _Standard_, _Echo_, and any others that occur to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, sir.",
        "And this stone?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes, I shall keep the stone.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And, I say, Peterson, just\nbuy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must\nhave one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your\nfamily is now devouring.\u201d\n\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held it\nagainst the light.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a bonny thing,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cJust see how it\nglints and sparkles.",
        "Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.",
        "Every good stone is.",
        "They are the devil\u2019s pet baits.",
        "In the larger and\nolder jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed.",
        "This stone is not\nyet twenty years old.",
        "It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in\nsouthern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the\ncarbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red.",
        "In spite\nof its youth, it has already a sinister history.",
        "There have been two\nmurders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought\nabout for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.",
        "Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows\nand the prison?",
        "I\u2019ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to\nthe Countess to say that we have it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think that this man Horner is innocent?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had\nanything to do with the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely\ninnocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was\nof considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold.",
        "That,\nhowever, I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer\nto our advertisement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you can do nothing until then?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case I shall continue my professional round.",
        "But I shall come\nback in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like\nto see the solution of so tangled a business.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery glad to see you.",
        "I dine at seven.",
        "There is a woodcock, I believe.",
        "By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs.",
        "Hudson to examine its crop.\u201d\n\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six\nwhen I found myself in Baker Street once more.",
        "As I approached the\nhouse I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was\nbuttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which\nwas thrown from the fanlight.",
        "Just as I arrived the door was opened,\nand we were shown up together to Holmes\u2019 room.",
        "\u201cMr.",
        "Henry Baker, I believe,\u201d said he, rising from his armchair and\ngreeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so\nreadily assume.",
        "\u201cPray take this chair by the fire, Mr.",
        "Baker.",
        "It is a\ncold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for\nsummer than for winter.",
        "Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right\ntime.",
        "Is that your hat, Mr.",
        "Baker?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.\u201d\n\nHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad,\nintelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown.",
        "A\ntouch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended\nhand, recalled Holmes\u2019 surmise as to his habits.",
        "His rusty black\nfrock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up,\nand his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff\nor shirt.",
        "He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with\ncare, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and\nletters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.",
        "\u201cWe have retained these things for some days,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cbecause we\nexpected to see an advertisement from you giving your address.",
        "I am at\na loss to know now why you did not advertise.\u201d\n\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh.",
        "\u201cShillings have not been so\nplentiful with me as they once were,\u201d he remarked.",
        "\u201cI had no doubt that\nthe gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the\nbird.",
        "I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at\nrecovering them.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery naturally.",
        "By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo eat it!\u201d Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.",
        "\u201cYes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.",
        "But I\npresume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the\nsame weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally\nwell?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, certainly, certainly,\u201d answered Mr.",
        "Baker with a sigh of relief.",
        "\u201cOf course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your\nown bird, so if you wish\u2014\u201d\n\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh.",
        "\u201cThey might be useful to me as\nrelics of my adventure,\u201d said he, \u201cbut beyond that I can hardly see\nwhat use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be\nto me.",
        "No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my\nattentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his\nshoulders.",
        "\u201cThere is your hat, then, and there your bird,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cBy the way,\nwould it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from?",
        "I am\nsomewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown\ngoose.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, sir,\u201d said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained\nproperty under his arm.",
        "\u201cThere are a few of us who frequent the Alpha\nInn, near the Museum\u2014we are to be found in the Museum itself during the\nday, you understand.",
        "This year our good host, Windigate by name,\ninstituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence\nevery week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas.",
        "My pence were\nduly paid, and the rest is familiar to you.",
        "I am much indebted to you,\nsir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.\u201d\nWith a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and\nstrode off upon his way.",
        "\u201cSo much for Mr.",
        "Henry Baker,\u201d said Holmes when he had closed the door\nbehind him.",
        "\u201cIt is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about\nthe matter.",
        "Are you hungry, Watson?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot particularly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up\nthis clue while it is still hot.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy all means.\u201d\n\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats\nabout our throats.",
        "Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a\ncloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke\nlike so many pistol shots.",
        "Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as\nwe swung through the doctors\u2019 quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street,\nand so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street.",
        "In a quarter of an\nhour we were in Bloomsbury at the Alpha Inn, which is a small\npublic-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into\nHolborn.",
        "Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two\nglasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.",
        "\u201cYour beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,\u201d said\nhe.",
        "\u201cMy geese!\u201d The man seemed surprised.",
        "\u201cYes.",
        "I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr.",
        "Henry Baker, who was\na member of your goose club.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!",
        "yes, I see.",
        "But you see, sir, them\u2019s not _our_ geese.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed!",
        "Whose, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed?",
        "I know some of them.",
        "Which was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cBreckinridge is his name.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!",
        "I don\u2019t know him.",
        "Well, here\u2019s your good health landlord, and\nprosperity to your house.",
        "Good-night.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow for Mr.",
        "Breckinridge,\u201d he continued, buttoning up his coat as we\ncame out into the frosty air.",
        "\u201cRemember, Watson that though we have so\nhomely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the\nother a man who will certainly get seven years\u2019 penal servitude unless\nwe can establish his innocence.",
        "It is possible that our inquiry may but\nconfirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation\nwhich has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has\nplaced in our hands.",
        "Let us follow it out to the bitter end.",
        "Faces to\nthe south, then, and quick march!\u201d\n\nWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag\nof slums to Covent Garden Market.",
        "One of the largest stalls bore the\nname of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man,\nwith a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up\nthe shutters.",
        "\u201cGood-evening.",
        "It\u2019s a cold night,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.",
        "\u201cSold out of geese, I see,\u201d continued Holmes, pointing at the bare\nslabs of marble.",
        "\u201cLet you have five hundred to-morrow morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s no good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, but I was recommended to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho by?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe landlord of the Alpha.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine birds they were, too.",
        "Now where did you get them from?\u201d\n\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the\nsalesman.",
        "\u201cNow, then, mister,\u201d said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo,\n\u201cwhat are you driving at?",
        "Let\u2019s have it straight, now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is straight enough.",
        "I should like to know who sold you the geese\nwhich you supplied to the Alpha.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, I shan\u2019t tell you.",
        "So now!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don\u2019t know why you should\nbe so warm over such a trifle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWarm!",
        "You\u2019d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.",
        "When I\npay good money for a good article there should be an end of the\nbusiness; but it\u2019s \u2018Where are the geese?\u2019 and \u2018Who did you sell the\ngeese to?\u2019 and \u2018What will you take for the geese?\u2019 One would think they\nwere the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over\nthem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I have no connection with any other people who have been making\ninquiries,\u201d said Holmes carelessly.",
        "\u201cIf you won\u2019t tell us the bet is\noff, that is all.",
        "But I\u2019m always ready to back my opinion on a matter\nof fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country\nbred.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, you\u2019ve lost your fiver, for it\u2019s town bred,\u201d snapped the\nsalesman.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing of the kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI say it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\n\u201cD\u2019you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them\never since I was a nipper?",
        "I tell you, all those birds that went to the\nAlpha were town bred.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never persuade me to believe that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you bet, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right.",
        "But I\u2019ll\nhave a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.\u201d\n\nThe salesman chuckled grimly.",
        "\u201cBring me the books, Bill,\u201d said he.",
        "The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great\ngreasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.",
        "\u201cNow then, Mr.",
        "Cocksure,\u201d said the salesman, \u201cI thought that I was out\nof geese, but before I finish you\u2019ll find that there is still one left\nin my shop.",
        "You see this little book?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the list of the folk from whom I buy.",
        "D\u2019you see?",
        "Well, then,\nhere on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their\nnames are where their accounts are in the big ledger.",
        "Now, then!",
        "You\nsee this other page in red ink?",
        "Well, that is a list of my town\nsuppliers.",
        "Now, look at that third name.",
        "Just read it out to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs.",
        "Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road\u2014249,\u201d read Holmes.",
        "\u201cQuite so.",
        "Now turn that up in the ledger.\u201d\n\nHolmes turned to the page indicated.",
        "\u201cHere you are, \u2018Mrs.",
        "Oakshott,\n117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, then, what\u2019s the last entry?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018December 22nd.",
        "Twenty-four geese at 7_s_.",
        "6_d_.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so.",
        "There you are.",
        "And underneath?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Sold to Mr.",
        "Windigate of the Alpha, at 12_s_.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat have you to say now?\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined.",
        "He drew a sovereign from his\npocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a\nman whose disgust is too deep for words.",
        "A few yards off he stopped\nunder a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which\nwas peculiar to him.",
        "\u201cWhen you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the \u2018Pink \u2019un\u2019\nprotruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,\u201d said\nhe.",
        "\u201cI daresay that if I had put \u00a3 100 down in front of him, that man\nwould not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him\nby the idea that he was doing me on a wager.",
        "Well, Watson, we are, I\nfancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains\nto be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs.",
        "Oakshott\nto-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow.",
        "It is clear\nfrom what that surly fellow said that there are others besides\nourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should\u2014\u201d\n\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out\nfrom the stall which we had just left.",
        "Turning round we saw a little\nrat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light\nwhich was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the\nsalesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists\nfiercely at the cringing figure.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of you and your geese,\u201d he shouted.",
        "\u201cI wish you were\nall at the devil together.",
        "If you come pestering me any more with your\nsilly talk I\u2019ll set the dog at you.",
        "You bring Mrs.",
        "Oakshott here and\nI\u2019ll answer her, but what have you to do with it?",
        "Did I buy the geese\noff you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo; but one of them was mine all the same,\u201d whined the little man.",
        "\u201cWell, then, ask Mrs.",
        "Oakshott for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me to ask you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care.",
        "I\u2019ve had enough\nof it.",
        "Get out of this!\u201d He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer\nflitted away into the darkness.",
        "\u201cHa!",
        "this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,\u201d whispered Holmes.",
        "\u201cCome\nwith me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.\u201d Striding\nthrough the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring\nstalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him\nupon the shoulder.",
        "He sprang round, and I could see in the gas-light\nthat every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.",
        "\u201cWho are you, then?",
        "What do you want?\u201d he asked in a quavering voice.",
        "\u201cYou will excuse me,\u201d said Holmes blandly, \u201cbut I could not help\noverhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.",
        "I\nthink that I could be of assistance to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou?",
        "Who are you?",
        "How could you know anything of the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Sherlock Holmes.",
        "It is my business to know what other\npeople don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you can know nothing of this?\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me, I know everything of it.",
        "You are endeavouring to trace some\ngeese which were sold by Mrs.",
        "Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman\nnamed Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr.",
        "Windigate, of the Alpha, and\nby him to his club, of which Mr.",
        "Henry Baker is a member.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,\u201d cried the\nlittle fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.",
        "\u201cI can\nhardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing.",
        "\u201cIn that case\nwe had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept\nmarket-place,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cBut pray tell me, before we go farther, who it\nis that I have the pleasure of assisting.\u201d\n\nThe man hesitated for an instant.",
        "\u201cMy name is John Robinson,\u201d he\nanswered with a sidelong glance.",
        "\u201cNo, no; the real name,\u201d said Holmes sweetly.",
        "\u201cIt is always awkward\ndoing business with an alias.\u201d\n\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger.",
        "\u201cWell then,\u201d said\nhe, \u201cmy real name is James Ryder.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely so.",
        "Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan.",
        "Pray step into\nthe cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you\nwould wish to know.\u201d\n\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with\nhalf-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he\nis on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.",
        "Then he stepped into\nthe cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker\nStreet.",
        "Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin\nbreathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of\nhis hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.",
        "\u201cHere we are!\u201d said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.",
        "\u201cThe\nfire looks very seasonable in this weather.",
        "You look cold, Mr.",
        "Ryder.",
        "Pray take the basket-chair.",
        "I will just put on my slippers before we\nsettle this little matter of yours.",
        "Now, then!",
        "You want to know what\nbecame of those geese?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr rather, I fancy, of that goose.",
        "It was one bird, I imagine in which\nyou were interested\u2014white, with a black bar across the tail.\u201d\n\nRyder quivered with emotion.",
        "\u201cOh, sir,\u201d he cried, \u201ccan you tell me\nwhere it went to?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt came here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and a most remarkable bird it proved.",
        "I don\u2019t wonder that you\nshould take an interest in it.",
        "It laid an egg after it was dead\u2014the\nbonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen.",
        "I have it here\nin my museum.\u201d\n\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his\nright hand.",
        "Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue\ncarbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant,\nmany-pointed radiance.",
        "Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain\nwhether to claim or to disown it.",
        "\u201cThe game\u2019s up, Ryder,\u201d said Holmes quietly.",
        "\u201cHold up, man, or you\u2019ll\nbe into the fire!",
        "Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson.",
        "He\u2019s not\ngot blood enough to go in for felony with impunity.",
        "Give him a dash of\nbrandy.",
        "So!",
        "Now he looks a little more human.",
        "What a shrimp it is, to\nbe sure!\u201d\n\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought\na tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened\neyes at his accuser.",
        "\u201cI have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could\npossibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.",
        "Still, that\nlittle may as well be cleared up to make the case complete.",
        "You had\nheard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,\u201d said he in a crackling\nvoice.",
        "\u201cI see\u2014her ladyship\u2019s waiting-maid.",
        "Well, the temptation of sudden\nwealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for\nbetter men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means\nyou used.",
        "It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very\npretty villain in you.",
        "You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had\nbeen concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would\nrest the more readily upon him.",
        "What did you do, then?",
        "You made some\nsmall job in my lady\u2019s room\u2014you and your confederate Cusack\u2014and you\nmanaged that he should be the man sent for.",
        "Then, when he had left, you\nrifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man\narrested.",
        "You then\u2014\u201d\n\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my\ncompanion\u2019s knees.",

        "\u201cThink of\nmy father!",
        "Of my mother!",
        "It would break their hearts.",
        "I never went\nwrong before!",
        "I never will again.",
        "I swear it.",
        "I\u2019ll swear it on a Bible.",
        "Oh, don\u2019t bring it into court!",
        "For Christ\u2019s sake, don\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cGet back into your chair!\u201d said Holmes sternly.",
        "\u201cIt is very well to\ncringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner\nin the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will fly, Mr.",
        "Holmes.",
        "I will leave the country, sir.",
        "Then the charge\nagainst him will break down.\u201d\n\n\u201cHum!",
        "We will talk about that.",
        "And now let us hear a true account of\nthe next act.",
        "How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose\ninto the open market?",
        "Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope\nof safety.\u201d\n\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips.",
        "\u201cI will tell you it just\nas it happened, sir,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cWhen Horner had been arrested, it\nseemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at\nonce, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take it\ninto their heads to search me and my room.",
        "There was no place about the\nhotel where it would be safe.",
        "I went out, as if on some commission, and\nI made for my sister\u2019s house.",
        "She had married a man named Oakshott, and\nlived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market.",
        "All the\nway there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a\ndetective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring\ndown my face before I came to the Brixton Road.",
        "My sister asked me what\nwas the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been\nupset by the jewel robbery at the hotel.",
        "Then I went into the back yard\nand smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.",
        "\u201cI had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just\nbeen serving his time in Pentonville.",
        "One day he had met me, and fell\ninto talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what\nthey stole.",
        "I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two\nthings about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where\nhe lived, and take him into my confidence.",
        "He would show me how to turn\nthe stone into money.",
        "But how to get to him in safety?",
        "I thought of the\nagonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel.",
        "I might at any\nmoment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my\nwaistcoat pocket.",
        "I was leaning against the wall at the time and\nlooking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and\nsuddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the\nbest detective that ever lived.",
        "\u201cMy sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of\nher geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as\ngood as her word.",
        "I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry my\nstone to Kilburn.",
        "There was a little shed in the yard, and behind this\nI drove one of the birds\u2014a fine big one, white, with a barred tail.",
        "I\ncaught it, and prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down its throat\nas far as my finger could reach.",
        "The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the\nstone pass along its gullet and down into its crop.",
        "But the creature\nflapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the\nmatter.",
        "As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered\noff among the others.",
        "\u201c\u2018Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?\u2019 says she.",
        "\u201c\u2018Well,\u2019 said I, \u2018you said you\u2019d give me one for Christmas, and I was\nfeeling which was the fattest.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 says she, \u2018we\u2019ve set yours aside for you\u2014Jem\u2019s bird, we call it.",
        "It\u2019s the big white one over yonder.",
        "There\u2019s twenty-six of them, which\nmakes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Thank you, Maggie,\u2019 says I; \u2018but if it is all the same to you, I\u2019d\nrather have that one I was handling just now.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018The other is a good three pound heavier,\u2019 said she, \u2018and we fattened\nit expressly for you.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Never mind.",
        "I\u2019ll have the other, and I\u2019ll take it now,\u2019 said I.",
        "\u201c\u2018Oh, just as you like,\u2019 said she, a little huffed.",
        "\u2018Which is it you\nwant, then?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the\nflock.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh, very well.",
        "Kill it and take it with you.\u2019\n\n\u201cWell, I did what she said, Mr.",
        "Holmes, and I carried the bird all the\nway to Kilburn.",
        "I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that it\nwas easy to tell a thing like that to.",
        "He laughed until he choked, and\nwe got a knife and opened the goose.",
        "My heart turned to water, for\nthere was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake\nhad occurred.",
        "I left the bird, rushed back to my sister\u2019s, and hurried\ninto the back yard.",
        "There was not a bird to be seen there.",
        "\u201c\u2018Where are they all, Maggie?\u2019 I cried.",
        "\u201c\u2018Gone to the dealer\u2019s, Jem.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Which dealer\u2019s?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018But was there another with a barred tail?\u2019 I asked, \u2018the same as the\none I chose?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell\nthem apart.\u2019\n\n\u201cWell, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet\nwould carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at\nonce, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone.",
        "You\nheard him yourselves to-night.",
        "Well, he has always answered me like\nthat.",
        "My sister thinks that I am going mad.",
        "Sometimes I think that I am\nmyself.",
        "And now\u2014and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever\nhaving touched the wealth for which I sold my character.",
        "God help me!",
        "God help me!\u201d He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in\nhis hands.",
        "There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the\nmeasured tapping of Sherlock Holmes\u2019 finger-tips upon the edge of the\ntable.",
        "Then my friend rose and threw open the door.",
        "\u201cGet out!\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cWhat, sir!",
        "Oh, Heaven bless you!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo more words.",
        "Get out!\u201d\n\nAnd no more words were needed.",
        "There was a rush, a clatter upon the\nstairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls\nfrom the street.",
        "\u201cAfter all, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay\npipe, \u201cI am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies.",
        "If\nHorner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will\nnot appear against him, and the case must collapse.",
        "I suppose that I am\ncommuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.",
        "This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.",
        "Send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life.",
        "Besides,\nit is the season of forgiveness.",
        "Chance has put in our way a most\nsingular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward.",
        "If\nyou will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin\nanother investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief\nfeature.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nVIII.",
        "THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND\n\n\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have\nduring the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock\nHolmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange,\nbut none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his\nart than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself\nwith any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even\nthe fantastic.",
        "Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any\nwhich presented more singular features than that which was associated\nwith the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.",
        "The\nevents in question occurred in the early days of my association with\nHolmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street.",
        "It is\npossible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a\npromise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been\nfreed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom\nthe pledge was given.",
        "It is perhaps as well that the facts should now\ncome to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread\nrumours as to the death of Dr.",
        "Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the\nmatter even more terrible than the truth.",
        "It was early in April in the year \u201983 that I woke one morning to find\nSherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed.",
        "He was\na late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me\nthat it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some\nsurprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself\nregular in my habits.",
        "\u201cVery sorry to knock you up, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cbut it\u2019s the common lot\nthis morning.",
        "Mrs.",
        "Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,\nand I on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it, then\u2014a fire?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo; a client.",
        "It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable\nstate of excitement, who insists upon seeing me.",
        "She is waiting now in\nthe sitting-room.",
        "Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at\nthis hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds,\nI presume that it is something very pressing which they have to\ncommunicate.",
        "Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am\nsure, wish to follow it from the outset.",
        "I thought, at any rate, that I\nshould call you and give you the chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\u201d\n\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional\ninvestigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as\nintuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he\nunravelled the problems which were submitted to him.",
        "I rapidly threw on\nmy clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down\nto the sitting-room.",
        "A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who\nhad been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.",
        "\u201cGood-morning, madam,\u201d said Holmes cheerily.",
        "\u201cMy name is Sherlock\nHolmes.",
        "This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr.",
        "Watson, before\nwhom you can speak as freely as before myself.",
        "Ha!",
        "I am glad to see\nthat Mrs.",
        "Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire.",
        "Pray draw up\nto it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that\nyou are shivering.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not cold which makes me shiver,\u201d said the woman in a low voice,\nchanging her seat as requested.",
        "\u201cWhat, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is fear, Mr.",
        "Holmes.",
        "It is terror.\u201d She raised her veil as she\nspoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of\nagitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes,\nlike those of some hunted animal.",
        "Her features and figure were those of\na woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her\nexpression was weary and haggard.",
        "Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one\nof his quick, all-comprehensive glances.",
        "\u201cYou must not fear,\u201d said he soothingly, bending forward and patting\nher forearm.",
        "\u201cWe shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt.",
        "You\nhave come in by train this morning, I see.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know me, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of\nyour left glove.",
        "You must have started early, and yet you had a good\ndrive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the\nstation.\u201d\n\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my\ncompanion.",
        "\u201cThere is no mystery, my dear madam,\u201d said he, smiling.",
        "\u201cThe left arm\nof your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places.",
        "The\nmarks are perfectly fresh.",
        "There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which\nthrows up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand\nside of the driver.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,\u201d said she.",
        "\u201cI\nstarted from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and\ncame in by the first train to Waterloo.",
        "Sir, I can stand this strain no\nlonger; I shall go mad if it continues.",
        "I have no one to turn to\u2014none,\nsave only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little\naid.",
        "I have heard of you, Mr.",
        "Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs.",
        "Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need.",
        "It was from\nher that I had your address.",
        "Oh, sir, do you not think that you could\nhelp me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense\ndarkness which surrounds me?",
        "At present it is out of my power to reward\nyou for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married,\nwith the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find\nme ungrateful.\u201d\n\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small\ncase-book, which he consulted.",
        "\u201cFarintosh,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cAh yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with\nan opal tiara.",
        "I think it was before your time, Watson.",
        "I can only say,\nmadam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I\ndid to that of your friend.",
        "As to reward, my profession is its own\nreward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put\nto, at the time which suits you best.",
        "And now I beg that you will lay\nbefore us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the\nmatter.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlas!\u201d replied our visitor, \u201cthe very horror of my situation lies in\nthe fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so\nentirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that\neven he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and\nadvice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a\nnervous woman.",
        "He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing\nanswers and averted eyes.",
        "But I have heard, Mr.",
        "Holmes, that you can\nsee deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart.",
        "You may\nadvise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am all attention, madam.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is\nthe last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the\nRoylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.\u201d\n\nHolmes nodded his head.",
        "\u201cThe name is familiar to me,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cThe family was at one time among the richest in England, and the\nestates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and\nHampshire in the west.",
        "In the last century, however, four successive\nheirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin\nwas eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency.",
        "Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the\ntwo-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy\nmortgage.",
        "The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the\nhorrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my\nstepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,\nobtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a\nmedical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional\nskill and his force of character, he established a large practice.",
        "In a\nfit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been\nperpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and\nnarrowly escaped a capital sentence.",
        "As it was, he suffered a long term\nof imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and\ndisappointed man.",
        "\u201cWhen Dr.",
        "Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs.",
        "Stoner, the\nyoung widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery.",
        "My sister\nJulia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of\nmy mother\u2019s re-marriage.",
        "She had a considerable sum of money\u2014not less\nthan \u00a3 1000 a year\u2014and this she bequeathed to Dr.",
        "Roylott entirely\nwhile we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum\nshould be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage.",
        "Shortly\nafter our return to England my mother died\u2014she was killed eight years\nago in a railway accident near Crewe.",
        "Dr.",
        "Roylott then abandoned his\nattempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live\nwith him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran.",
        "The money which my\nmother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no\nobstacle to our happiness.",
        "\u201cBut a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.",
        "Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours,\nwho had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in\nthe old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came\nout save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his\npath.",
        "Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in\nthe men of the family, and in my stepfather\u2019s case it had, I believe,\nbeen intensified by his long residence in the tropics.",
        "A series of\ndisgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court,\nuntil at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would\nfly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and\nabsolutely uncontrollable in his anger.",
        "\u201cLast week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,\nand it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather\ntogether that I was able to avert another public exposure.",
        "He had no\nfriends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these\nvagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land\nwhich represent the family estate, and would accept in return the\nhospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for\nweeks on end.",
        "He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent\nover to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and\na baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the\nvillagers almost as much as their master.",
        "\u201cYou can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no\ngreat pleasure in our lives.",
        "No servant would stay with us, and for a\nlong time we did all the work of the house.",
        "She was but thirty at the\ntime of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even\nas mine has.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour sister is dead, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to\nspeak to you.",
        "You can understand that, living the life which I have\ndescribed, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and\nposition.",
        "We had, however, an aunt, my mother\u2019s maiden sister, Miss\nHonoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally\nallowed to pay short visits at this lady\u2019s house.",
        "Julia went there at\nChristmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to\nwhom she became engaged.",
        "My stepfather learned of the engagement when\nmy sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within\na fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the\nterrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed\nand his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and\nglanced across at his visitor.",
        "\u201cPray be precise as to details,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cIt is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is\nseared into my memory.",
        "The manor-house is, as I have already said, very\nold, and only one wing is now inhabited.",
        "The bedrooms in this wing are\non the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of\nthe buildings.",
        "Of these bedrooms the first is Dr.",

        "Do I make myself\nplain?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfectly so.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn.",
        "That fatal\nnight Dr.",
        "Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he\nhad not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the\nstrong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke.",
        "She left her\nroom, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time,\nchatting about her approaching wedding.",
        "At eleven o\u2019clock she rose to\nleave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.",
        "\u201c\u2018Tell me, Helen,\u2019 said she, \u2018have you ever heard anyone whistle in the\ndead of the night?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Never,\u2019 said I.",
        "\u201c\u2018I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your\nsleep?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Certainly not.",
        "But why?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the\nmorning, heard a low, clear whistle.",
        "I am a light sleeper, and it has\nawakened me.",
        "I cannot tell where it came from\u2014perhaps from the next\nroom, perhaps from the lawn.",
        "I thought that I would just ask you\nwhether you had heard it.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No, I have not.",
        "It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Very likely.",
        "And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did\nnot hear it also.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.\u2019 She smiled back at\nme, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the\nlock.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cWas it your custom always to lock yourselves in\nat night?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a\nbaboon.",
        "We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so.",
        "Pray proceed with your statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could not sleep that night.",
        "A vague feeling of impending misfortune\nimpressed me.",
        "My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you\nknow how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely\nallied.",
        "It was a wild night.",
        "The wind was howling outside, and the rain\nwas beating and splashing against the windows.",
        "Suddenly, amid all the\nhubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified\nwoman.",
        "I knew that it was my sister\u2019s voice.",
        "I sprang from my bed,\nwrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor.",
        "As I opened my\ndoor I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a\nfew moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.",
        "As I ran down the passage, my sister\u2019s door was unlocked, and revolved\nslowly upon its hinges.",
        "I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing\nwhat was about to issue from it.",
        "By the light of the corridor-lamp I\nsaw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her\nhands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that\nof a drunkard.",
        "I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that\nmoment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.",
        "She\nwrithed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully\nconvulsed.",
        "At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I\nbent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never\nforget, \u2018Oh, my God!",
        "Helen!",
        "It was the band!",
        "The speckled band!\u2019 There\nwas something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with\nher finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor\u2019s room, but a\nfresh convulsion seized her and choked her words.",
        "I rushed out, calling\nloudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his\ndressing-gown.",
        "When he reached my sister\u2019s side she was unconscious,\nand though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid\nfrom the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and\ndied without having recovered her consciousness.",
        "Such was the dreadful\nend of my beloved sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d said Holmes, \u201care you sure about this whistle and\nmetallic sound?",
        "Could you swear to it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry.",
        "It is my\nstrong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale\nand the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas your sister dressed?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she was in her night-dress.",
        "In her right hand was found the\ncharred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.\u201d\n\n\u201cShowing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the\nalarm took place.",
        "That is important.",
        "And what conclusions did the\ncoroner come to?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe investigated the case with great care, for Dr.",
        "Roylott\u2019s conduct\nhad long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any\nsatisfactory cause of death.",
        "My evidence showed that the door had been\nfastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by\nold-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every\nnight.",
        "The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite\nsolid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with\nthe same result.",
        "The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large\nstaples.",
        "It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when\nshe met her end.",
        "Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon\nher.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow about poison?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe doctors examined her for it, but without success.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though\nwhat it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere there gipsies in the plantation at the time?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, there are nearly always some there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band\u2014a speckled\nband?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,\nsometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to\nthese very gipsies in the plantation.",
        "I do not know whether the spotted\nhandkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have\nsuggested the strange adjective which she used.\u201d\n\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.",
        "\u201cThese are very deep waters,\u201d said he; \u201cpray go on with your\nnarrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately\nlonelier than ever.",
        "A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have\nknown for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in\nmarriage.",
        "His name is Armitage\u2014Percy Armitage\u2014the second son of Mr.",
        "Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading.",
        "My stepfather has offered no\nopposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the\nspring.",
        "Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the\nbuilding, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to\nmove into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very\nbed in which she slept.",
        "Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last\nnight, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly\nheard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the\nherald of her own death.",
        "I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was\nto be seen in the room.",
        "I was too shaken to go to bed again, however,\nso I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a\ndog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead,\nfrom whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing\nyou and asking your advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have done wisely,\u201d said my friend.",
        "\u201cBut have you told me all?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, all.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Roylott, you have not.",
        "You are screening your stepfather.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, what do you mean?\u201d\n\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the\nhand that lay upon our visitor\u2019s knee.",
        "Five little livid spots, the\nmarks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.",
        "\u201cYou have been cruelly used,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist.",
        "\u201cHe is a\nhard man,\u201d she said, \u201cand perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.\u201d\n\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his\nhands and stared into the crackling fire.",
        "\u201cThis is a very deep business,\u201d he said at last.",
        "\u201cThere are a thousand\ndetails which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course\nof action.",
        "Yet we have not a moment to lose.",
        "If we were to come to\nStoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms\nwithout the knowledge of your stepfather?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most\nimportant business.",
        "It is probable that he will be away all day, and\nthat there would be nothing to disturb you.",
        "We have a housekeeper now,\nbut she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent.",
        "You are not averse to this trip, Watson?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we shall both come.",
        "What are you going to do yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in\ntown.",
        "But I shall return by the twelve o\u2019clock train, so as to be there\nin time for your coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you may expect us early in the afternoon.",
        "I have myself some small\nbusiness matters to attend to.",
        "Will you not wait and breakfast?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I must go.",
        "My heart is lightened already since I have confided my\ntrouble to you.",
        "I shall look forward to seeing you again this\nafternoon.\u201d She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided\nfrom the room.",
        "\u201cAnd what do you think of it all, Watson?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes,\nleaning back in his chair.",
        "\u201cIt seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.\u201d\n\n\u201cDark enough and sinister enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are\nsound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her\nsister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious\nend.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very\npeculiar words of the dying woman?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot think.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a\nband of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the\nfact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an\ninterest in preventing his stepdaughter\u2019s marriage, the dying allusion\nto a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a\nmetallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars\nthat secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that\nthere is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along\nthose lines.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what, then, did the gipsies do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot imagine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see many objections to any such theory.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to\nStoke Moran this day.",
        "I want to see whether the objections are fatal,\nor if they may be explained away.",
        "But what in the name of the devil!\u201d\n\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our\ndoor had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed\nhimself in the aperture.",
        "His costume was a peculiar mixture of the\nprofessional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long\nfrock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in\nhis hand.",
        "So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of\nthe doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to\nside.",
        "A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with\nthe sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the\nother of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\nfleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird\nof prey.",
        "\u201cWhich of you is Holmes?\u201d asked this apparition.",
        "\u201cMy name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,\u201d said my companion\nquietly.",
        "\u201cI am Dr.",
        "Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, Doctor,\u201d said Holmes blandly.",
        "\u201cPray take a seat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will do nothing of the kind.",
        "My stepdaughter has been here.",
        "I have\ntraced her.",
        "What has she been saying to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a little cold for the time of the year,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cWhat has she been saying to you?\u201d screamed the old man furiously.",
        "\u201cBut I have heard that the crocuses promise well,\u201d continued my\ncompanion imperturbably.",
        "\u201cHa!",
        "You put me off, do you?\u201d said our new visitor, taking a step\nforward and shaking his hunting-crop.",
        "\u201cI know you, you scoundrel!",
        "I\nhave heard of you before.",
        "You are Holmes, the meddler.\u201d\n\nMy friend smiled.",
        "\u201cHolmes, the busybody!\u201d\n\nHis smile broadened.",
        "\u201cHolmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!\u201d\n\nHolmes chuckled heartily.",
        "\u201cYour conversation is most entertaining,\u201d\nsaid he.",
        "\u201cWhen you go out close the door, for there is a decided\ndraught.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will go when I have had my say.",
        "Don\u2019t you dare to meddle with my\naffairs.",
        "I know that Miss Stoner has been here.",
        "I traced her!",
        "I am a\ndangerous man to fall foul of!",
        "See here.\u201d He stepped swiftly forward,\nseized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.",
        "\u201cSee that you keep yourself out of my grip,\u201d he snarled, and hurling\nthe twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.",
        "\u201cHe seems a very amiable person,\u201d said Holmes, laughing.",
        "\u201cI am not\nquite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my\ngrip was not much more feeble than his own.\u201d As he spoke he picked up\nthe steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.",
        "\u201cFancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\ndetective force!",
        "This incident gives zest to our investigation,\nhowever, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from\nher imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her.",
        "And now, Watson, we\nshall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors\u2019\nCommons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this\nmatter.\u201d\n\nIt was nearly one o\u2019clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\nexcursion.",
        "He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over\nwith notes and figures.",
        "\u201cI have seen the will of the deceased wife,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cTo determine its\nexact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the\ninvestments with which it is concerned.",
        "The total income, which at the\ntime of the wife\u2019s death was little short of \u00a3 1,100, is now, through\nthe fall in agricultural prices, not more than \u00a3 750.",
        "Each daughter can\nclaim an income of \u00a3 250, in case of marriage.",
        "It is evident,\ntherefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a\nmere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very\nserious extent.",
        "My morning\u2019s work has not been wasted, since it has\nproved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way\nof anything of the sort.",
        "And now, Watson, this is too serious for\ndawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting\nourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and\ndrive to Waterloo.",
        "I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\nrevolver into your pocket.",
        "An Eley\u2019s No.",
        "2 is an excellent argument\nwith gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots.",
        "That and a\ntooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.\u201d\n\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,\nwhere we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five\nmiles through the lovely Surrey lanes.",
        "It was a perfect day, with a\nbright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens.",
        "The trees and\nwayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the\nair was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth.",
        "To me at least\nthere was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring\nand this sinister quest upon which we were engaged.",
        "My companion sat in\nthe front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his\neyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.",
        "Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed\nover the meadows.",
        "\u201cLook there!\u201d said he.",
        "A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into\na grove at the highest point.",
        "From amid the branches there jutted out\nthe grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.",
        "\u201cStoke Moran?\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cYes, sir, that be the house of Dr.",
        "Grimesby Roylott,\u201d remarked the\ndriver.",
        "\u201cThere is some building going on there,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cthat is where we\nare going.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the village,\u201d said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs\nsome distance to the left; \u201cbut if you want to get to the house, you\u2019ll\nfind it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the\nfields.",
        "There it is, where the lady is walking.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,\u201d observed Holmes, shading his\neyes.",
        "\u201cYes, I think we had better do as you suggest.\u201d\n\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to\nLeatherhead.",
        "\u201cI thought it as well,\u201d said Holmes as we climbed the stile, \u201cthat this\nfellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite\nbusiness.",
        "It may stop his gossip.",
        "Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner.",
        "You see\nthat we have been as good as our word.\u201d\n\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face\nwhich spoke her joy.",
        "\u201cI have been waiting so eagerly for you,\u201d she\ncried, shaking hands with us warmly.",
        "\u201cAll has turned out splendidly.",
        "Dr.",
        "Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back\nbefore evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have had the pleasure of making the Doctor\u2019s acquaintance,\u201d said\nHolmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred.",
        "Miss\nStoner turned white to the lips as she listened.",
        "\u201cGood heavens!\u201d she cried, \u201che has followed me, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it appears.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him.",
        "What will\nhe say when he returns?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more\ncunning than himself upon his track.",
        "You must lock yourself up from him\nto-night.",
        "If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt\u2019s at\nHarrow.",
        "Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us\nat once to the rooms which we are to examine.\u201d\n\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central\nportion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on\neach side.",
        "In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked\nwith wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of\nruin.",
        "The central portion was in little better repair, but the\nright-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the\nwindows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that\nthis was where the family resided.",
        "Some scaffolding had been erected\nagainst the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\nthere were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit.",
        "Holmes\nwalked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep\nattention the outsides of the windows.",
        "\u201cThis, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the\ncentre one to your sister\u2019s, and the one next to the main building to\nDr.",
        "Roylott\u2019s chamber?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly so.",
        "But I am now sleeping in the middle one.\u201d\n\n\u201cPending the alterations, as I understand.",
        "By the way, there does not\nseem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were none.",
        "I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\nroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!",
        "that is suggestive.",
        "Now, on the other side of this narrow wing\nruns the corridor from which these three rooms open.",
        "There are windows\nin it, of course?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but very small ones.",
        "Too narrow for anyone to pass through.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\nfrom that side.",
        "Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room\nand bar your shutters?\u201d\n\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the\nopen window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but\nwithout success.",
        "There was no slit through which a knife could be\npassed to raise the bar.",
        "Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but\nthey were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry.",
        "\u201cHum!\u201d\nsaid he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, \u201cmy theory certainly\npresents some difficulties.",
        "No one could pass these shutters if they\nwere bolted.",
        "Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the\nmatter.\u201d\n\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the\nthree bedrooms opened.",
        "Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so\nwe passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now\nsleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate.",
        "It was a\nhomely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after\nthe fashion of old country-houses.",
        "A brown chest of drawers stood in\none corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a\ndressing-table on the left-hand side of the window.",
        "These articles,\nwith two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\nroom save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre.",
        "The boards round\nand the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old\nand discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of\nthe house.",
        "Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,\nwhile his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in\nevery detail of the apartment.",
        "\u201cWhere does that bell communicate with?\u201d he asked at last pointing to a\nthick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually\nlying upon the pillow.",
        "\u201cIt goes to the housekeeper\u2019s room.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks newer than the other things?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour sister asked for it, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I never heard of her using it.",
        "We used always to get what we\nwanted for ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.",
        "You\nwill excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this\nfloor.\u201d He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand\nand crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks\nbetween the boards.",
        "Then he did the same with the wood-work with which\nthe chamber was panelled.",
        "Finally he walked over to the bed and spent\nsome time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.",
        "Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.",
        "\u201cWhy, it\u2019s a dummy,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cWon\u2019t it ring?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it is not even attached to a wire.",
        "This is very interesting.",
        "You\ncan see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little\nopening for the ventilator is.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow very absurd!",
        "I never noticed that before.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery strange!\u201d muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope.",
        "\u201cThere are one or\ntwo very singular points about this room.",
        "For example, what a fool a\nbuilder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the\nsame trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is also quite modern,\u201d said the lady.",
        "\u201cDone about the same time as the bell-rope?\u201d remarked Holmes.",
        "\u201cYes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey seem to have been of a most interesting character\u2014dummy\nbell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate.",
        "With your\npermission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the\ninner apartment.\u201d\n\nDr.",
        "Grimesby Roylott\u2019s chamber was larger than that of his\nstep-daughter, but was as plainly furnished.",
        "A camp-bed, a small wooden\nshelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair\nbeside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,\nand a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.",
        "Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the\nkeenest interest.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s in here?\u201d he asked, tapping the safe.",
        "\u201cMy stepfather\u2019s business papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!",
        "you have seen inside, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly once, some years ago.",
        "I remember that it was full of papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a cat in it, for example?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
        "What a strange idea!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, look at this!\u201d He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on\nthe top of it.",
        "\u201cNo; we don\u2019t keep a cat.",
        "But there is a cheetah and a baboon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, yes, of course!",
        "Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a\nsaucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.",
        "There is one point which I should wish to determine.\u201d He squatted down\nin front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the\ngreatest attention.",
        "\u201cThank you.",
        "That is quite settled,\u201d said he, rising and putting his\nlens in his pocket.",
        "\u201cHullo!",
        "Here is something interesting!\u201d\n\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one\ncorner of the bed.",
        "The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied\nso as to make a loop of whipcord.",
        "\u201cWhat do you make of that, Watson?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a common enough lash.",
        "But I don\u2019t know why it should be tied.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not quite so common, is it?",
        "Ah, me!",
        "it\u2019s a wicked world, and\nwhen a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all.",
        "I\nthink that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your\npermission we shall walk out upon the lawn.\u201d\n\nI had never seen my friend\u2019s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was\nwhen we turned from the scene of this investigation.",
        "We had walked\nseveral times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself\nliking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his\nreverie.",
        "\u201cIt is very essential, Miss Stoner,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you should\nabsolutely follow my advice in every respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall most certainly do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe matter is too serious for any hesitation.",
        "Your life may depend\nupon your compliance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI assure you that I am in your hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your\nroom.\u201d\n\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.",
        "\u201cYes, it must be so.",
        "Let me explain.",
        "I believe that that is the village\ninn over there?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that is the Crown.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good.",
        "Your windows would be visible from there?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,\nwhen your stepfather comes back.",
        "Then when you hear him retire for the\nnight, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put\nyour lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with\neverything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to\noccupy.",
        "I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage\nthere for one night.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, easily.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rest you will leave in our hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what will you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the\ncause of this noise which has disturbed you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe, Mr.",
        "Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,\u201d said\nMiss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion\u2019s sleeve.",
        "\u201cPerhaps I have.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, for pity\u2019s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister\u2019s\ndeath.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she\ndied from some sudden fright.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I do not think so.",
        "I think that there was probably some more\ntangible cause.",
        "And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr.",
        "Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.",
        "Good-bye, and\nbe brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured\nthat we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and\nsitting-room at the Crown Inn.",
        "They were on the upper floor, and from\nour window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the\ninhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House.",
        "At dusk we saw Dr.",
        "Grimesby\nRoylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure\nof the lad who drove him.",
        "The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing\nthe heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor\u2019s\nvoice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.",
        "The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring\nup among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.",
        "\u201cDo you know, Watson,\u201d said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering\ndarkness, \u201cI have really some scruples as to taking you to-night.",
        "There\nis a distinct element of danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I be of assistance?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour presence might be invaluable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I shall certainly come.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very kind of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou speak of danger.",
        "You have evidently seen more in these rooms than\nwas visible to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more.",
        "I imagine that\nyou saw all that I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that\ncould answer I confess is more than I can imagine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saw the ventilator, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a\nsmall opening between two rooms.",
        "It was so small that a rat could\nhardly pass through.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke\nMoran.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, I did.",
        "You remember in her statement she said that her sister\ncould smell Dr.",
        "Roylott\u2019s cigar.",
        "Now, of course that suggested at once\nthat there must be a communication between the two rooms.",
        "It could only\nbe a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner\u2019s\ninquiry.",
        "I deduced a ventilator.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what harm can there be in that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates.",
        "A ventilator\nis made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies.",
        "Does\nnot that strike you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot as yet see any connection.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was clamped to the floor.",
        "Did you ever see a bed fastened like that\nbefore?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot say that I have.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lady could not move her bed.",
        "It must always be in the same\nrelative position to the ventilator and to the rope\u2014or so we may call\nit, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\u201d\n\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d I cried, \u201cI seem to see dimly what you are hinting at.",
        "We are\nonly just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubtle enough and horrible enough.",
        "When a doctor does go wrong he is\nthe first of criminals.",
        "He has nerve and he has knowledge.",
        "Palmer and\nPritchard were among the heads of their profession.",
        "This man strikes\neven deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike\ndeeper still.",
        "But we shall have horrors enough before the night is\nover; for goodness\u2019 sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds\nfor a few hours to something more cheerful.\u201d\n\nAbout nine o\u2019clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all\nwas dark in the direction of the Manor House.",
        "Two hours passed slowly\naway, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright\nlight shone out right in front of us.",
        "\u201cThat is our signal,\u201d said Holmes, springing to his feet; \u201cit comes\nfrom the middle window.\u201d\n\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining\nthat we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was\npossible that we might spend the night there.",
        "A moment later we were\nout on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow\nlight twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our\nsombre errand.",
        "There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired\nbreaches gaped in the old park wall.",
        "Making our way among the trees, we\nreached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the\nwindow when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed\nto be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass\nwith writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the\ndarkness.",
        "\u201cMy God!\u201d I whispered; \u201cdid you see it?\u201d\n\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice\nupon my wrist in his agitation.",
        "Then he broke into a low laugh and put\nhis lips to my ear.",
        "\u201cIt is a nice household,\u201d he murmured.",
        "\u201cThat is the baboon.\u201d\n\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected.",
        "There was a\ncheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any\nmoment.",
        "I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following\nHolmes\u2019 example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the\nbedroom.",
        "My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp\nonto the table, and cast his eyes round the room.",
        "All was as we had\nseen it in the daytime.",
        "Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of\nhis hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that\nI could do to distinguish the words:\n\n\u201cThe least sound would be fatal to our plans.\u201d\n\nI nodded to show that I had heard.",
        "\u201cWe must sit without light.",
        "He would see it through the ventilator.\u201d\n\nI nodded again.",
        "\u201cDo not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it.",
        "Have your pistol\nready in case we should need it.",
        "I will sit on the side of the bed, and\nyou in that chair.\u201d\n\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.",
        "Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed\nbeside him.",
        "By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.",
        "Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.",
        "How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil?",
        "I could not hear a sound,\nnot even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat\nopen-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous\ntension in which I was myself.",
        "The shutters cut off the least ray of\nlight, and we waited in absolute darkness.",
        "From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our\nvery window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah\nwas indeed at liberty.",
        "Far away we could hear the deep tones of the\nparish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour.",
        "How long they\nseemed, those quarters!",
        "Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and\nstill we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.",
        "Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction\nof the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a\nstrong smell of burning oil and heated metal.",
        "Someone in the next room\nhad lit a dark-lantern.",
        "I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then\nall was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger.",
        "For half an\nhour I sat with straining ears.",
        "Then suddenly another sound became\naudible\u2014a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of\nsteam escaping continually from a kettle.",
        "The instant that we heard it,\nHolmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\nhis cane at the bell-pull.",
        "\u201cYou see it, Watson?\u201d he yelled.",
        "\u201cYou see it?\u201d\n\nBut I saw nothing.",
        "At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a\nlow, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes\nmade it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed\nso savagely.",
        "I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and\nfilled with horror and loathing.",
        "He had ceased to strike and was gazing\nup at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the\nnight the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened.",
        "It swelled\nup louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all\nmingled in the one dreadful shriek.",
        "They say that away down in the\nvillage, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the\nsleepers from their beds.",
        "It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood\ngazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died\naway into the silence from which it rose.",
        "\u201cWhat can it mean?\u201d I gasped.",
        "\u201cIt means that it is all over,\u201d Holmes answered.",
        "\u201cAnd perhaps, after\nall, it is for the best.",
        "Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.",
        "Roylott\u2019s room.\u201d\n\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.",
        "Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.",
        "Then\nhe turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked\npistol in my hand.",
        "It was a singular sight which met our eyes.",
        "On the table stood a\ndark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of\nlight upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.",
        "Beside this\ntable, on the wooden chair, sat Dr.",
        "Grimesby Roylott clad in a long\ngrey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet\nthrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.",
        "Across his lap lay the short\nstock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day.",
        "His chin\nwas cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at\nthe corner of the ceiling.",
        "Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow\nband, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round\nhis head.",
        "As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.",
        "\u201cThe band!",
        "the speckled band!\u201d whispered Holmes.",
        "I took a step forward.",
        "In an instant his strange headgear began to\nmove, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat\ndiamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.",
        "\u201cIt is a swamp adder!\u201d cried Holmes; \u201cthe deadliest snake in India.",
        "He\nhas died within ten seconds of being bitten.",
        "Violence does, in truth,\nrecoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he\ndigs for another.",
        "Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we\ncan then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county\npolice know what has happened.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man\u2019s lap, and\nthrowing the noose round the reptile\u2019s neck he drew it from its horrid\nperch and, carrying it at arm\u2019s length, threw it into the iron safe,\nwhich he closed upon it.",
        "Such are the true facts of the death of Dr.",
        "Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke\nMoran.",
        "It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has\nalready run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news\nto the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the\ncare of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official\ninquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while\nindiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet.",
        "The little which I had yet\nto learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled\nback next day.",
        "\u201cI had,\u201d said he, \u201ccome to an entirely erroneous conclusion which\nshows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\ninsufficient data.",
        "The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word\n\u2018band,\u2019 which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the\nappearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of\nher match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent.",
        "I\ncan only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position\nwhen, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an\noccupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.",
        "My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to\nthis ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed.",
        "The\ndiscovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the\nfloor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as\na bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.",
        "The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it\nwith my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of\ncreatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track.",
        "The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be\ndiscovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a\nclever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training.",
        "The rapidity\nwith which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point\nof view, be an advantage.",
        "It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who\ncould distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where\nthe poison fangs had done their work.",
        "Then I thought of the whistle.",
        "Of\ncourse he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to\nthe victim.",
        "He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we\nsaw, to return to him when summoned.",
        "He would put it through this\nventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it\nwould crawl down the rope and land on the bed.",
        "It might or might not\nbite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but\nsooner or later she must fall a victim.",
        "\u201cI had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room.",
        "An\ninspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of\nstanding on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he\nshould reach the ventilator.",
        "The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,\nand the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which\nmay have remained.",
        "The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was\nobviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe\nupon its terrible occupant.",
        "Having once made up my mind, you know the\nsteps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof.",
        "I heard the\ncreature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit\nthe light and attacked it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the result of driving it through the ventilator.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the\nother side.",

        "Hatherley\u2019s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton\u2019s madness.",
        "Of\nthese the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and\noriginal observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so\ndramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed\nupon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those\ndeductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable\nresults.",
        "The story has, I believe, been told more than once in the\nnewspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less\nstriking when set forth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than\nwhen the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery\nclears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which\nleads on to the complete truth.",
        "At the time the circumstances made a\ndeep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served\nto weaken the effect.",
        "It was in the summer of \u201989, not long after my marriage, that the\nevents occurred which I am now about to summarise.",
        "I had returned to\ncivil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street\nrooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally even\npersuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit\nus.",
        "My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at no\nvery great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from\namong the officials.",
        "One of these, whom I had cured of a painful and\nlingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of\nendeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any\ninfluence.",
        "One morning, at a little before seven o\u2019clock, I was awakened by the\nmaid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from\nPaddington and were waiting in the consulting-room.",
        "I dressed\nhurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom\ntrivial, and hastened downstairs.",
        "As I descended, my old ally, the\nguard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve got him here,\u201d he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder;\n\u201che\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some\nstrange creature which he had caged up in my room.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a new patient,\u201d he whispered.",
        "\u201cI thought I\u2019d bring him round\nmyself; then he couldn\u2019t slip away.",

        "He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap\nwhich he had laid down upon my books.",
        "Round one of his hands he had a\nhandkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains.",
        "He\nwas young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong,\nmasculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression\nof a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took\nall his strength of mind to control.",
        "\u201cI am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I have had\na very serious accident during the night.",
        "I came in by train this\nmorning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a\ndoctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here.",
        "I gave the maid a\ncard, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.\u201d\n\nI took it up and glanced at it.",
        "\u201cMr.",
        "Victor Hatherley, hydraulic\nengineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor).\u201d That was the name, style,\nand abode of my morning visitor.",

        "\u201cYou are fresh from\na night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous\noccupation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, my night could not be called monotonous,\u201d said he, and laughed.",

        "All my medical instincts rose up against\nthat laugh.",
        "\u201cStop it!\u201d I cried; \u201cpull yourself together!\u201d and I poured out some\nwater from a caraffe.",
        "It was useless, however.",
        "He was off in one of those hysterical\noutbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is\nover and gone.",
        "Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and\npale-looking.",
        "\u201cI have been making a fool of myself,\u201d he gasped.",
        "\u201cNot at all.",
        "Drink this.\u201d I dashed some brandy into the water, and the\ncolour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s better!\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cAnd now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly\nattend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.\u201d\n\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand.",
        "It gave even my\nhardened nerves a shudder to look at it.",
        "There were four protruding\nfingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have\nbeen.",
        "It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.",
        "\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried, \u201cthis is a terrible injury.",
        "It must have bled\nconsiderably.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it did.",
        "I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have\nbeen senseless for a long time.",
        "When I came to I found that it was\nstill bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round\nthe wrist and braced it up with a twig.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent!",
        "You should have been a surgeon.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own\nprovince.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has been done,\u201d said I, examining the wound, \u201cby a very heavy and\nsharp instrument.\u201d\n\n\u201cA thing like a cleaver,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cAn accident, I presume?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy no means.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat!",
        "a murderous attack?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery murderous indeed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou horrify me.\u201d\n\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it\nover with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages.",
        "He lay back without\nwincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.",
        "\u201cHow is that?\u201d I asked when I had finished.",
        "\u201cCapital!",
        "Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.",
        "I was\nvery weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you had better not speak of the matter.",
        "It is evidently trying\nto your nerves.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, not now.",
        "I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,\nbetween ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this\nwound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for\nit is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof\nwith which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which\nI can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will\nbe done.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa!\u201d cried I, \u201cif it is anything in the nature of a problem which you\ndesire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my\nfriend, Mr.",
        "Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the official police.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I have heard of that fellow,\u201d answered my visitor, \u201cand I should\nbe very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must\nuse the official police as well.",
        "Would you give me an introduction to\nhim?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do better.",
        "I\u2019ll take you round to him myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should be immensely obliged to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll call a cab and go together.",
        "We shall just be in time to have a\nlittle breakfast with him.",
        "Do you feel equal to it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an\ninstant.\u201d I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife,\nand in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new\nacquaintance to Baker Street.",
        "Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in\nhis dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _The Times_ and smoking\nhis before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and\ndottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and\ncollected on the corner of the mantelpiece.",
        "He received us in his\nquietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us\nin a hearty meal.",
        "When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance\nupon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of\nbrandy and water within his reach.",
        "\u201cIt is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.",
        "Hatherley,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cPray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely\nat home.",
        "Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up\nyour strength with a little stimulant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said my patient, \u201cbut I have felt another man since the\ndoctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the\ncure.",
        "I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I\nshall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.\u201d\n\nHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression\nwhich veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him,\nand we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor\ndetailed to us.",
        "\u201cYou must know,\u201d said he, \u201cthat I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing\nalone in lodgings in London.",
        "By profession I am a hydraulic engineer,\nand I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven\nyears that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known firm,\nof Greenwich.",
        "Two years ago, having served my time, and having also\ncome into a fair sum of money through my poor father\u2019s death, I\ndetermined to start in business for myself and took professional\nchambers in Victoria Street.",
        "\u201cI suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business\na dreary experience.",
        "To me it has been exceptionally so.",
        "During two\nyears I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is\nabsolutely all that my profession has brought me.",
        "My gross takings\namount to \u00a3 27 10_s_.",
        "Every day, from nine in the morning until four in\nthe afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began\nto sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at\nall.",
        "\u201cYesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my\nclerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me\nupon business.",
        "He brought up a card, too, with the name of \u2018Colonel\nLysander Stark\u2019 engraved upon it.",
        "Close at his heels came the colonel\nhimself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding\nthinness.",
        "I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man.",
        "His whole\nface sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was\ndrawn quite tense over his outstanding bones.",
        "Yet this emaciation\nseemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was\nbright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured.",
        "He was plainly but\nneatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than\nthirty.",
        "\u201c\u2018Mr.",
        "Hatherley?\u2019 said he, with something of a German accent.",
        "\u2018You have\nbeen recommended to me, Mr.",
        "Hatherley, as being a man who is not only\nproficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of\npreserving a secret.\u2019\n\n\u201cI bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an\naddress.",
        "\u2018May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at\nthis moment.",
        "I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan\nand a bachelor and are residing alone in London.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018That is quite correct,\u2019 I answered; \u2018but you will excuse me if I say\nthat I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional\nqualifications.",
        "I understand that it was on a professional matter that\nyou wished to speak to me?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Undoubtedly so.",
        "But you will find that all I say is really to the\npoint.",
        "I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy\nis quite essential\u2014absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we\nmay expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in\nthe bosom of his family.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018If I promise to keep a secret,\u2019 said I, \u2018you may absolutely depend\nupon my doing so.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had\nnever seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.",
        "\u201c\u2018Do you promise, then?\u2019 said he at last.",
        "\u201c\u2018Yes, I promise.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after?",
        "No reference\nto the matter at all, either in word or writing?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I have already given you my word.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Very good.\u2019 He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across\nthe room he flung open the door.",
        "The passage outside was empty.",
        "\u201c\u2018That\u2019s all right,\u2019 said he, coming back.",
        "\u2018I know that clerks are\nsometimes curious as to their master\u2019s affairs.",
        "Now we can talk in\nsafety.\u2019 He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at\nme again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.",
        "\u201cA feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to\nrise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man.",
        "Even my\ndread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my\nimpatience.",
        "\u201c\u2018I beg that you will state your business, sir,\u2019 said I; \u2018my time is of\nvalue.\u2019 Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to\nmy lips.",
        "\u201c\u2018How would fifty guineas for a night\u2019s work suit you?\u2019 he asked.",
        "\u201c\u2018Most admirably.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I say a night\u2019s work, but an hour\u2019s would be nearer the mark.",
        "I\nsimply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has\ngot out of gear.",
        "If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it\nright ourselves.",
        "What do you think of such a commission as that?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Precisely so.",
        "We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Where to?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018To Eyford, in Berkshire.",
        "It is a little place near the borders of\nOxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading.",
        "There is a train from\nPaddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Very good.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018There is a drive, then?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes, our little place is quite out in the country.",
        "It is a good seven\nmiles from Eyford Station.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Then we can hardly get there before midnight.",
        "I suppose there would\nbe no chance of a train back.",
        "I should be compelled to stop the night.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018That is very awkward.",
        "Could I not come at some more convenient hour?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018We have judged it best that you should come late.",
        "It is to recompense\nyou for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and\nunknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of\nyour profession.",
        "Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the\nbusiness, there is plenty of time to do so.\u2019\n\n\u201cI thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be\nto me.",
        "\u2018Not at all,\u2019 said I, \u2018I shall be very happy to accommodate\nmyself to your wishes.",
        "I should like, however, to understand a little\nmore clearly what it is that you wish me to do.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Quite so.",
        "It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have\nexacted from you should have aroused your curiosity.",
        "I have no wish to\ncommit you to anything without your having it all laid before you.",
        "I\nsuppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Entirely.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Then the matter stands thus.",
        "You are probably aware that\nfuller\u2019s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one\nor two places in England?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I have heard so.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Some little time ago I bought a small place\u2014a very small place\u2014within\nten miles of Reading.",
        "I was fortunate enough to discover that there was\na deposit of fuller\u2019s-earth in one of my fields.",
        "On examining it,\nhowever, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and\nthat it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right\nand left\u2014both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours.",
        "These\ngood people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that\nwhich was quite as valuable as a gold-mine.",
        "Naturally, it was to my\ninterest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but\nunfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this.",
        "I took a few\nof my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we\nshould quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in\nthis way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the\nneighbouring fields.",
        "This we have now been doing for some time, and in\norder to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press.",
        "This\npress, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish\nyour advice upon the subject.",
        "We guard our secret very jealously,\nhowever, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers\ncoming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if\nthe facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these\nfields and carrying out our plans.",
        "That is why I have made you promise\nme that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford\nto-night.",
        "I hope that I make it all plain?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I quite follow you,\u2019 said I.",
        "\u2018The only point which I could not quite\nunderstand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in\nexcavating fuller\u2019s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like\ngravel from a pit.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Ah!\u2019 said he carelessly, \u2018we have our own process.",
        "We compress the\nearth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they\nare.",
        "But that is a mere detail.",
        "I have taken you fully into my\nconfidence now, Mr.",
        "Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.\u2019\nHe rose as he spoke.",
        "\u2018I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I shall certainly be there.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018And not a word to a soul.\u2019 He looked at me with a last long,\nquestioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he\nhurried from the room.",
        "\u201cWell, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much\nastonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had\nbeen intrusted to me.",
        "On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the\nfee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price\nupon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to\nother ones.",
        "On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had\nmade an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that his\nexplanation of the fuller\u2019s-earth was sufficient to explain the\nnecessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I\nshould tell anyone of my errand.",
        "However, I threw all fears to the\nwinds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off,\nhaving obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.",
        "\u201cAt Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.",
        "However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the\nlittle dim-lit station after eleven o\u2019clock.",
        "I was the only passenger\nwho got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single\nsleepy porter with a lantern.",
        "As I passed out through the wicket gate,\nhowever, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow\nupon the other side.",
        "Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me\ninto a carriage, the door of which was standing open.",
        "He drew up the\nwindows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as\nfast as the horse could go.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne horse?\u201d interjected Holmes.",
        "\u201cYes, only one.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you observe the colour?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the\ncarriage.",
        "It was a chestnut.\u201d\n\n\u201cTired-looking or fresh?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, fresh and glossy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.",
        "I am sorry to have interrupted you.",
        "Pray continue your most\ninteresting statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAway we went then, and we drove for at least an hour.",
        "Colonel Lysander\nStark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from\nthe rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it\nmust have been nearer twelve.",
        "He sat at my side in silence all the\ntime, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction,\nthat he was looking at me with great intensity.",
        "The country roads seem\nto be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and\njolted terribly.",
        "I tried to look out of the windows to see something of\nwhere we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make\nout nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light.",
        "Now and\nthen I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but\nthe colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon\nflagged.",
        "At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for\nthe crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a\nstand.",
        "Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him,\npulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us.",
        "We stepped,\nas it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I\nfailed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house.",
        "The\ninstant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily\nbehind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage\ndrove away.",
        "\u201cIt was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about\nlooking for matches and muttering under his breath.",
        "Suddenly a door\nopened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light\nshot out in our direction.",
        "It grew broader, and a woman appeared with a\nlamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face\nforward and peering at us.",
        "I could see that she was pretty, and from\nthe gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it\nwas a rich material.",
        "She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a\ntone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a\ngruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from\nher hand.",
        "Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,\nand then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he\nwalked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.",
        "\u201c\u2018Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few\nminutes,\u2019 said he, throwing open another door.",
        "It was a quiet, little,\nplainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which\nseveral German books were scattered.",
        "Colonel Stark laid down the lamp\non the top of a harmonium beside the door.",
        "\u2018I shall not keep you\nwaiting an instant,\u2019 said he, and vanished into the darkness.",
        "\u201cI glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of\nGerman I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the\nothers being volumes of poetry.",
        "Then I walked across to the window,\nhoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak\nshutter, heavily barred, was folded across it.",
        "It was a wonderfully\nsilent house.",
        "There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the\npassage, but otherwise everything was deadly still.",
        "A vague feeling of\nuneasiness began to steal over me.",
        "Who were these German people, and\nwhat were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place?",
        "And\nwhere was the place?",
        "I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was all I\nknew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea.",
        "For that\nmatter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that\nradius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all.",
        "Yet it was\nquite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the\ncountry.",
        "I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath\nto keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my\nfifty-guinea fee.",
        "\u201cSuddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter\nstillness, the door of my room swung slowly open.",
        "The woman was\nstanding in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the\nyellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face.",
        "I\ncould see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a\nchill to my own heart.",
        "She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be\nsilent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her\neyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom\nbehind her.",
        "\u201c\u2018I would go,\u2019 said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak\ncalmly; \u2018I would go.",
        "I should not stay here.",
        "There is no good for you\nto do.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018But, madam,\u2019 said I, \u2018I have not yet done what I came for.",
        "I cannot\npossibly leave until I have seen the machine.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018It is not worth your while to wait,\u2019 she went on.",
        "\u2018You can pass\nthrough the door; no one hinders.\u2019 And then, seeing that I smiled and\nshook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step\nforward, with her hands wrung together.",
        "\u2018For the love of Heaven!\u2019 she\nwhispered, \u2018get away from here before it is too late!\u2019\n\n\u201cBut I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage\nin an affair when there is some obstacle in the way.",
        "I thought of my\nfifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night\nwhich seemed to be before me.",
        "Was it all to go for nothing?",
        "Why should\nI slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the\npayment which was my due?",
        "This woman might, for all I knew, be a\nmonomaniac.",
        "With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had\nshaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head and\ndeclared my intention of remaining where I was.",
        "She was about to renew\nher entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several\nfootsteps was heard upon the stairs.",
        "She listened for an instant, threw\nup her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as\nnoiselessly as she had come.",
        "\u201cThe newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a\nchinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was\nintroduced to me as Mr.",
        "Ferguson.",
        "\u201c\u2018This is my secretary and manager,\u2019 said the colonel.",
        "\u2018By the way, I\nwas under the impression that I left this door shut just now.",
        "I fear\nthat you have felt the draught.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018On the contrary,\u2019 said I, \u2018I opened the door myself because I felt\nthe room to be a little close.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe shot one of his suspicious looks at me.",
        "\u2018Perhaps we had better\nproceed to business, then,\u2019 said he.",
        "\u2018Mr.",
        "Ferguson and I will take you\nup to see the machine.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I had better put my hat on, I suppose.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh, no, it is in the house.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018What, you dig fuller\u2019s-earth in the house?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No, no.",
        "This is only where we compress it.",
        "But never mind that.",
        "All\nwe wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is\nwrong with it.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat\nmanager and I behind him.",
        "It was a labyrinth of an old house, with\ncorridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors,\nthe thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had\ncrossed them.",
        "There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above\nthe ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the\ndamp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches.",
        "I tried to put\non as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten the\nwarnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen\neye upon my two companions.",
        "Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent\nman, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least\na fellow-countryman.",
        "\u201cColonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he\nunlocked.",
        "Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us\ncould hardly get at one time.",
        "Ferguson remained outside, and the\ncolonel ushered me in.",
        "\u201c\u2018We are now,\u2019 said he, \u2018actually within the hydraulic press, and it\nwould be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn\nit on.",
        "The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the\ndescending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon\nthis metal floor.",
        "There are small lateral columns of water outside\nwhich receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the\nmanner which is familiar to you.",
        "The machine goes readily enough, but\nthere is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little\nof its force.",
        "Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to\nshow us how we can set it right.\u2019\n\n\u201cI took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.",
        "It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous\npressure.",
        "When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers\nwhich controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there\nwas a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through\none of the side cylinders.",
        "An examination showed that one of the\nindia-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk\nso as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked.",
        "This was\nclearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my\ncompanions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several\npractical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right.",
        "When\nI had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the\nmachine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity.",
        "It was\nobvious at a glance that the story of the fuller\u2019s-earth was the merest\nfabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an\nengine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose.",
        "The walls were of\nwood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came\nto examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it.",
        "I\nhad stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I\nheard a muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of\nthe colonel looking down at me.",
        "\u201c\u2018What are you doing there?\u2019 he asked.",
        "\u201cI felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that\nwhich he had told me.",
        "\u2018I was admiring your fuller\u2019s-earth,\u2019 said I; \u2018I\nthink that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if\nI knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my\nspeech.",
        "His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey\neyes.",
        "\u201c\u2018Very well,\u2019 said he, \u2018you shall know all about the machine.\u2019 He took\na step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the\nlock.",
        "I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite\nsecure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves.",
        "\u2018Hullo!\u2019\nI yelled.",
        "\u2018Hullo!",
        "Colonel!",
        "Let me out!\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart\ninto my mouth.",
        "It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the\nleaking cylinder.",
        "He had set the engine at work.",
        "The lamp still stood\nupon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough.",
        "By its\nlight I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,\njerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must\nwithin a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp.",
        "I threw myself,\nscreaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock.",
        "I\nimplored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the\nlevers drowned my cries.",
        "The ceiling was only a foot or two above my\nhead, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.",
        "Then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend\nvery much upon the position in which I met it.",
        "If I lay on my face the\nweight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that\ndreadful snap.",
        "Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve\nto lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?",
        "Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which\nbrought a gush of hope back to my heart.",
        "\u201cI have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls\nwere of wood.",
        "As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line\nof yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and\nbroadened as a small panel was pushed backward.",
        "For an instant I could\nhardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.",
        "The next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the\nother side.",
        "The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the\nlamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,\ntold me how narrow had been my escape.",
        "\u201cI was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I\nfound myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a\nwoman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held\na candle in her right.",
        "It was the same good friend whose warning I had\nso foolishly rejected.",
        "\u201c\u2018Come!",
        "come!\u2019 she cried breathlessly.",
        "\u2018They will be here in a moment.",
        "They will see that you are not there.",
        "Oh, do not waste the so-precious\ntime, but come!\u2019\n\n\u201cThis time, at least, I did not scorn her advice.",
        "I staggered to my\nfeet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair.",
        "The\nlatter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard\nthe sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering\nthe other from the floor on which  we were and from the one beneath.",
        "My\nguide stopped and looked about her like one  who is at her wit\u2019s end.",
        "Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window\nof which the moon was shining brightly.",
        "\u201c\u2018It is your only chance,\u2019 said she.",
        "\u2018It is high, but it may be that\nyou can jump it.\u2019\n\n\u201cAs she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the\npassage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing\nforward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher\u2019s\ncleaver in the other.",
        "I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the\nwindow, and looked out.",
        "How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden\nlooked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet\ndown.",
        "I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I\nshould have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who\npursued me.",
        "If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to\ngo back to her assistance.",
        "The thought had hardly flashed through my\nmind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw\nher arms round him and tried to hold him back.",
        "\u201c\u2018Fritz!",
        "Fritz!\u2019 she cried in English, \u2018remember your promise after the\nlast time.",
        "You said it should not be again.",
        "He will be silent!",
        "Oh, he\nwill be silent!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018You are mad, Elise!\u2019 he shouted, struggling to break away from her.",
        "\u2018You will be the ruin of us.",
        "He has seen too much.",
        "Let me pass, I say!\u2019\nHe dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with\nhis heavy weapon.",
        "I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to\nthe sill, when his blow fell.",
        "I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip\nloosened, and I fell into the garden below.",
        "\u201cI was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and\nrushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood\nthat I was far from being out of danger yet.",
        "Suddenly, however, as I\nran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.",
        "I glanced down at my\nhand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw\nthat my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my\nwound.",
        "I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a\nsudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among\nthe rose-bushes.",
        "\u201cHow long I remained unconscious I cannot tell.",
        "It must have been a\nvery long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was\nbreaking when I came to myself.",
        "My clothes were all sodden with dew,\nand my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb.",
        "The\nsmarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night\u2019s\nadventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly\nyet be safe from my pursuers.",
        "But to my astonishment, when I came to\nlook round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen.",
        "I had been\nlying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road, and just a little\nlower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it,\nto be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night.",
        "Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during\nthose dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.",
        "\u201cHalf dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.",
        "There would be one to Reading in less than an hour.",
        "The same porter was\non duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived.",
        "I inquired of him\nwhether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark.",
        "The name was\nstrange to him.",
        "Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for\nme?",
        "No, he had not.",
        "Was there a police-station anywhere near?",
        "There was\none about three miles off.",
        "\u201cIt was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was.",
        "I determined to\nwait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police.",
        "It\nwas a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound\ndressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here.",
        "I\nput the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.\u201d\n\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this\nextraordinary narrative.",
        "Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the\nshelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his\ncuttings.",
        "\u201cHere is an advertisement which will interest you,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cIt\nappeared in all the papers about a year ago.",
        "Listen to this: \u2018Lost, on\nthe 9th inst., Mr.",
        "Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic\nengineer.",
        "Left his lodgings at ten o\u2019clock at night, and has not been\nheard of since.",
        "Was dressed in,\u2019 etc., etc.",
        "Ha!",
        "That represents the\nlast time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I\nfancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d cried my patient.",
        "\u201cThen that explains what the girl\nsaid.\u201d\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly.",
        "It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and\ndesperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand\nin the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will\nleave no survivor from a captured ship.",
        "Well, every moment now is\nprecious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard\nat once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.\u201d\n\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,\nbound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.",
        "There were Sherlock\nHolmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard,\na plain-clothes man, and myself.",
        "Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map\nof the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing\na circle with Eyford for its centre.",
        "\u201cThere you are,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cThat circle is drawn at a radius of ten\nmiles from the village.",
        "The place we want must be somewhere near that\nline.",
        "You said ten miles, I think, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an hour\u2019s good drive.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think that they brought you back all that way when you were\nunconscious?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey must have done so.",
        "I have a confused memory, too, of having been\nlifted and conveyed somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I cannot understand,\u201d said I, \u201cis why they should have spared you\nwhen they found you lying fainting in the garden.",
        "Perhaps the villain\nwas softened by the woman\u2019s entreaties.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hardly think that likely.",
        "I never saw a more inexorable face in my\nlife.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we shall soon clear up all that,\u201d said Bradstreet.",
        "\u201cWell, I have\ndrawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk\nthat we are in search of are to be found.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I could lay my finger on it,\u201d said Holmes quietly.",
        "\u201cReally, now!\u201d cried the inspector, \u201cyou have formed your opinion!",
        "Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you.",
        "I say it is south, for the\ncountry is more deserted there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I say east,\u201d said my patient.",
        "\u201cI am for west,\u201d remarked the plain-clothes man.",

        "How could it be that if it had\ngone twelve miles over heavy roads?\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, it is a likely ruse enough,\u201d observed Bradstreet thoughtfully.",
        "\u201cOf course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone at all,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cThey are coiners on a large scale, and\nhave used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of\nsilver.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,\u201d said the\ninspector.",
        "\u201cThey have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand.",
        "We\neven traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they\nhad covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old\nhands.",
        "But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got\nthem right enough.\u201d\n\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined\nto fall into the hands of justice.",
        "As we rolled into Eyford Station we\nsaw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small\nclump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich\nfeather over the landscape.",
        "\u201cA house on fire?\u201d asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on\nits way.",
        "\u201cYes, sir!\u201d said the station-master.",
        "\u201cWhen did it break out?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and\nthe whole place is in a blaze.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose house is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cDr.",
        "Becher\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me,\u201d broke in the engineer, \u201cis Dr.",
        "Becher a German, very thin,\nwith a long, sharp nose?\u201d\n\nThe station-master laughed heartily.",
        "\u201cNo, sir, Dr.",
        "Becher is an\nEnglishman, and there isn\u2019t a man in the parish who has a better-lined\nwaistcoat.",
        "But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as I\nunderstand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good\nBerkshire beef would do him no harm.\u201d\n\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all\nhastening in the direction of the fire.",
        "The road topped a low hill, and\nthere was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us,\nspouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front\nthree fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d cried Hatherley, in intense excitement.",
        "\u201cThere is the\ngravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay.",
        "That second\nwindow is the one that I jumped from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, at least,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cyou have had your revenge upon them.",
        "There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was\ncrushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt\nthey were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.",
        "Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night,\nthough I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.\u201d\n\nAnd Holmes\u2019 fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no\nword has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister\nGerman, or the morose Englishman.",
        "Early that morning a peasant had met\na cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving\nrapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the\nfugitives disappeared, and even Holmes\u2019 ingenuity failed ever to\ndiscover the least clue as to their whereabouts.",
        "The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which\nthey had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed\nhuman thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.",
        "About sunset,\nhowever, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the\nflames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been\nreduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and\niron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our\nunfortunate acquaintance so dearly.",
        "Large masses of nickel and of tin\nwere discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,\nwhich may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have\nbeen already referred to.",
        "How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the\nspot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a\nmystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain\ntale.",
        "He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom\nhad remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones.",
        "On the\nwhole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold\nor less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear\nthe unconscious man out of the way of danger.",
        "\u201cWell,\u201d said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once\nmore to London, \u201cit has been a pretty business for me!",
        "I have lost my\nthumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?\u201d\n\n\u201cExperience,\u201d said Holmes, laughing.",
        "\u201cIndirectly it may be of value,\nyou know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of\nbeing excellent company for the remainder of your existence.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR\n\n\nThe Lord St.",
        "Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long\nceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which\nthe unfortunate bridegroom moves.",
        "Fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and\ntheir more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this\nfour-year-old drama.",
        "As I have reason to believe, however, that the\nfull facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my\nfriend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter\nup, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little\nsketch of this remarkable episode.",
        "It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was\nstill sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from\nan afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him.",
        "I\nhad remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn\nto rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I had\nbrought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign\nthrobbed with dull persistence.",
        "With my body in one easy-chair and my\nlegs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers\nuntil at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all\naside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the\nenvelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend\u2019s noble\ncorrespondent could be.",
        "\u201cHere is a very fashionable epistle,\u201d I remarked as he entered.",
        "\u201cYour\nmorning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a\ntide-waiter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,\u201d he\nanswered, smiling, \u201cand the humbler are usually the more interesting.",
        "This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon\na man either to be bored or to lie.\u201d\n\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.",
        "\u201cOh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot social, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, distinctly professional.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd from a noble client?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the highest in England.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow, I congratulate you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my\nclient is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.",
        "It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this\nnew investigation.",
        "You have been reading the papers diligently of late,\nhave you not?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks like it,\u201d said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the\ncorner.",
        "\u201cI have had nothing else to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up.",

        "Simon,\nwho has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little\ngod\u2019s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage\nwith Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California\nmillionaire.",
        "Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face\nattracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only\nchild, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to\nconsiderably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future.",

        "Simon has\nno property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor, it is\nobvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an\nalliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition\nfrom a Republican lady to a British peeress.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything else?\u201d asked Holmes, yawning.",
        "\u201cOh, yes; plenty.",

        "It was only after\na painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and\nthe footman.",

        "Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed\nher, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber\nfor an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the\npassage.",
        "One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the\nhouse thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his\nmistress, believing her to be with the company.",
        "On ascertaining that\nhis daughter had disappeared, Mr.",
        "Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with\nthe bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the\npolice, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will\nprobably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.",
        "Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the\nwhereabouts of the missing lady.",
        "There are rumours of foul play in the\nmatter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the\nwoman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from\njealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the\nstrange disappearance of the bride.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd is that all?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a\nsuggestive one.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has\nactually been arrested.",

        "Holmes,\u201d said he, \u201cmy wife was twenty before her\nfather became a rich man.",
        "During that time she ran free in a mining\ncamp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has\ncome from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster.",
        "She is what we call\nin England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by\nany sort of traditions.",
        "She is impetuous\u2014volcanic, I was about to say.",
        "She is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her\nresolutions.",
        "On the other hand, I would not have given her the name\nwhich I have the honour to bear\u201d\u2014he gave a little stately cough\u2014\u201chad I\nnot thought her to be at bottom a noble woman.",
        "I believe that she is\ncapable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would\nbe repugnant to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you her photograph?\u201d\n\n\u201cI brought this with me.\u201d He opened a locket and showed us the full\nface of a very lovely woman.",
        "It was not a photograph but an ivory\nminiature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the\nlustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.",

        "Not more than is usual in my family.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait\naccompli_?\u201d\n\n\u201cI really have made no inquiries on the subject.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery naturally not.",
        "Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the\nwedding?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas she in good spirits?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever better.",

        "That is very interesting.",
        "And on the morning of the wedding?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was as bright as possible\u2014at least until after the ceremony.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd did you observe any change in her then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever\nseen that her temper was just a little sharp.",
        "The incident however, was\ntoo trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cPray let us have it, for all that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it is childish.",

        "There was a moment\u2019s delay, but the gentleman in the pew\nhanded it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for\nthe fall.",
        "Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me\nabruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly\nagitated over this trifling cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed!",
        "You say that there was a gentleman in the pew.",
        "Some of the\ngeneral public were present, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes.",
        "It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis gentleman was not one of your wife\u2019s friends?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a\ncommon-looking person.",

        "Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful\nframe of mind than she had gone to it.",
        "What did she do on re-entering\nher father\u2019s house?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw her in conversation with her maid.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who is her maid?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlice is her name.",
        "She is an American and came from California with\nher.\u201d\n\n\u201cA confidential servant?\u201d\n\n\u201cA little too much so.",
        "It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to\ntake great liberties.",
        "Still, of course, in America they look upon these\nthings in a different way.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long did she speak to this Alice?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, a few minutes.",
        "I had something else to think of.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did not overhear what they said?\u201d\n\n\u201cLady St.",
        "Simon said something about \u2018jumping a claim.\u2019 She was\naccustomed to use slang of the kind.",
        "I have no idea what she meant.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican slang is very expressive sometimes.",
        "And what did your wife do\nwhen she finished speaking to her maid?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe walked into the breakfast-room.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn your arm?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, alone.",
        "She was very independent in little matters like that.",
        "Then,\nafter we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly,\nmuttered some words of apology, and left the room.",
        "She never came\nback.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her\nroom, covered her bride\u2019s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet,\nand went out.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so.",
        "And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in\ncompany with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had\nalready made a disturbance at Mr.",

        "She used to be at the Allegro.",
        "I have not treated her\nungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but\nyou know what women are, Mr.",
        "Holmes.",
        "Flora was a dear little thing, but\nexceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me.",
        "She wrote me\ndreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, and, to\ntell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly\nwas that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church.",
        "She came\nto Mr.",
        "Doran\u2019s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push\nher way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even\nthreatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the\nsort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon\npushed her out again.",
        "She was quiet when she saw that there was no good\nin making a row.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid your wife hear all this?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank goodness, she did not.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
        "That is what Mr.",
        "Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so\nserious.",
        "It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some\nterrible trap for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it is a possible supposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think so, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not say a probable one.",
        "But you do not yourself look upon this\nas likely?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not think Flora would hurt a fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters.",
        "Pray what is\nyour own theory as to what took place?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one.",
        "I have\ngiven you all the facts.",
        "Since you ask me, however, I may say that it\nhas occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the\nconsciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the\neffect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short, that she had become suddenly deranged?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, really, when I consider that she has turned her back\u2014I will not\nsay upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without\nsuccess\u2014I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,\u201d said Holmes,\nsmiling.",
        "\u201cAnd now, Lord St.",
        "Simon, I think that I have nearly all my\ndata.",
        "May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that\nyou could see out of the window?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could see the other side of the road and the Park.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so.",
        "Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer.",
        "I\nshall communicate with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cShould you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,\u201d said our\nclient, rising.",
        "\u201cI have solved it.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh?",
        "What was that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI say that I have solved it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere, then, is my wife?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a detail which I shall speedily supply.\u201d\n\nLord St.",
        "Simon shook his head.",
        "\u201cI am afraid that it will take wiser\nheads than yours or mine,\u201d he remarked, and bowing in a stately,\nold-fashioned manner he departed.",
        "\u201cIt is very good of Lord St.",
        "Simon to honour my head by putting it on a\nlevel with his own,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, laughing.",
        "\u201cI think that I\nshall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this\ncross-questioning.",
        "I had formed my conclusions as to the case before\nour client came into the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Holmes!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked\nbefore, which were quite as prompt.",
        "My whole examination served to turn\nmy conjecture into a certainty.",
        "Circumstantial evidence is occasionally\nvery convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote\nThoreau\u2019s example.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I have heard all that you have heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me\nso well.",
        "There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and\nsomething on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the\nFranco-Prussian War.",
        "It is one of these cases\u2014but, hullo, here is\nLestrade!",
        "Good-afternoon, Lestrade!",
        "You will find an extra tumbler upon\nthe sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.\u201d\n\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which\ngave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas\nbag in his hand.",
        "With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the\ncigar which had been offered to him.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s up, then?\u201d asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye.",
        "\u201cYou look\ndissatisfied.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I feel dissatisfied.",
        "It is this infernal St.",
        "Simon marriage case.",
        "I can make neither head nor tail of the business.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally!",
        "You surprise me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho ever heard of such a mixed affair?",
        "Every clue seems to slip\nthrough my fingers.",
        "I have been at work upon it all day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd very wet it seems to have made you,\u201d said Holmes laying his hand\nupon the arm of the pea-jacket.",
        "\u201cYes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Heaven\u2019s name, what for?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn search of the body of Lady St.",
        "Simon.\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.",
        "\u201cHave you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?\u201d he asked.",
        "\u201cWhy?",
        "What do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one\nas in the other.\u201d\n\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion.",
        "\u201cI suppose you know all\nabout it,\u201d he snarled.",
        "\u201cWell, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, indeed!",
        "Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the\nmatter?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it very unlikely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in\nit?\u201d He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a\nwedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a\nbride\u2019s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water.",
        "\u201cThere,\u201d\nsaid he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile.",
        "\u201cThere is\na little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, indeed!\u201d said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.",
        "\u201cYou\ndragged them from the Serpentine?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
        "They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.",
        "They\nhave been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the\nclothes were there the body would not be far off.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the same brilliant reasoning, every man\u2019s body is to be found in\nthe neighbourhood of his wardrobe.",
        "And pray what did you hope to arrive\nat through this?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid that you will find it difficult.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you, indeed, now?\u201d cried Lestrade with some bitterness.",
        "\u201cI am\nafraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions\nand your inferences.",
        "You have made two blunders in as many minutes.",
        "This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the dress is a pocket.",
        "In the pocket is a card-case.",
        "In the\ncard-case is a note.",
        "And here is the very note.\u201d He slapped it down\nupon the table in front of him.",
        "\u201cListen to this: \u2018You will see me when\nall is ready.",
        "Come at once.",
        "F. H. M.\u2019 Now my theory all along has been\nthat Lady St.",
        "Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she,\nwith confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.",
        "Here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt\nquietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within\ntheir reach.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good, Lestrade,\u201d said Holmes, laughing.",
        "\u201cYou really are very fine\nindeed.",
        "Let me see it.\u201d He took up the paper in a listless way, but his\nattention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of\nsatisfaction.",
        "\u201cThis is indeed important,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cHa!",
        "you find it so?\u201d\n\n\u201cExtremely so.",
        "I congratulate you warmly.\u201d\n\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look.",
        "\u201cWhy,\u201d he\nshrieked, \u201cyou\u2019re looking at the wrong side!\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, this is the right side.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe right side?",
        "You\u2019re mad!",
        "Here is the note written in pencil over\nhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill,\nwhich interests me deeply.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in it.",
        "I looked at it before,\u201d said Lestrade.",
        "\u201c\u2018Oct.",

        "6_d_., cocktail 1_s_., lunch 2_s_.",
        "6_d_., glass sherry, 8_d_.\u2019 I see nothing in that.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery likely not.",
        "It is most important, all the same.",
        "As to the note,\nit is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate\nyou again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wasted time enough,\u201d said Lestrade, rising.",
        "\u201cI believe in hard\nwork and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.",
        "Good-day,\nMr.",
        "Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter\nfirst.\u201d He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made\nfor the door.",
        "\u201cJust one hint to you, Lestrade,\u201d drawled Holmes before his rival\nvanished; \u201cI will tell you the true solution of the matter.",
        "Lady St.",
        "Simon is a myth.",
        "There is not, and there never has been, any such\nperson.\u201d\n\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion.",
        "Then he turned to me, tapped his\nforehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.",
        "He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his\novercoat.",
        "\u201cThere is something in what the fellow says about outdoor\nwork,\u201d he remarked, \u201cso I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your\npapers for a little.\u201d\n\nIt was after five o\u2019clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no\ntime to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner\u2019s\nman with a very large flat box.",
        "This he unpacked with the help of a\nyouth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great\nastonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out\nupon our humble lodging-house mahogany.",
        "There were a couple of brace of\ncold woodcock, a pheasant, a _p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras_ pie with a group of\nancient and cobwebby bottles.",
        "Having laid out all these luxuries, my\ntwo visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with\nno explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered\nto this address.",
        "Just before nine o\u2019clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.",
        "His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which\nmade me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.",

        "\u201cYou seem to expect company.",

        "Ha!",
        "I fancy that\nI hear his step now upon the stairs.\u201d\n\nIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,\ndangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very\nperturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.",
        "\u201cMy messenger reached you, then?\u201d asked Holmes.",
        "\u201cYes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.",

        "I cannot allow that there is any\nhumiliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, you look on these things from another standpoint.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fail to see that anyone is to blame.",

        "\u201cLord St.",
        "Simon,\u201d said he \u201callow me to introduce you to Mr.",
        "and Mrs.",
        "Francis Hay Moulton.",
        "The lady, I think, you have already met.\u201d\n\nAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and\nstood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the\nbreast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity.",
        "The lady had\ntaken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he\nstill refused to raise his eyes.",
        "It was as well for his resolution,\nperhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re angry, Robert,\u201d said she.",
        "\u201cWell, I guess you have every cause\nto be.\u201d\n\n\u201cPray make no apology to me,\u201d said Lord St.",
        "Simon bitterly.",
        "\u201cOh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should\nhave spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from\nthe time when I saw Frank here again I just didn\u2019t know what I was\ndoing or saying.",
        "I only wonder I didn\u2019t fall down and do a faint right\nthere before the altar.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps, Mrs.",
        "Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the\nroom while you explain this matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I may give an opinion,\u201d remarked the strange gentleman, \u201cwe\u2019ve had\njust a little too much secrecy over this business already.",
        "For my part,\nI should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.\u201d He was\na small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert\nmanner.",
        "\u201cThen I\u2019ll tell our story right away,\u201d said the lady.",
        "\u201cFrank here and I\nmet in \u201984, in McQuire\u2019s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa was working a\nclaim.",
        "We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day\nfather struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had\na claim that petered out and came to nothing.",
        "The richer Pa grew the\npoorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn\u2019t hear of our engagement lasting\nany longer, and he took me away to \u2019Frisco.",
        "Frank wouldn\u2019t throw up his\nhand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing\nanything about it.",
        "It would only have made him mad to know, so we just\nfixed it all up for ourselves.",
        "Frank said that he would go and make his\npile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa.",
        "So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged\nmyself not to marry anyone else while he lived.",
        "\u2018Why shouldn\u2019t we be\nmarried right away, then,\u2019 said he, \u2018and then I will feel sure of you;\nand I won\u2019t claim to be your husband until I come back?\u2019 Well, we\ntalked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman\nall ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank\nwent off to seek his fortune, and I went back to Pa.",
        "\u201cThe next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went\nprospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico.",
        "After\nthat came a long newspaper story about how a miners\u2019 camp had been\nattacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank\u2019s name among the\nkilled.",
        "I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after.",
        "Pa\nthought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in \u2019Frisco.",
        "Not\na word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that\nFrank was really dead.",
        "Then Lord St.",
        "Simon came to \u2019Frisco, and we came\nto London, and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I\nfelt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place\nin my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.",
        "\u201cStill, if I had married Lord St.",
        "Simon, of course I\u2019d have done my\nduty by him.",
        "We can\u2019t command our love, but we can our actions.",
        "I went\nto the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a\nwife as it was in me to be.",
        "But you may imagine what I felt when, just\nas I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing and\nlooking at me out of the first pew.",
        "I thought it was his ghost at\nfirst; but when I looked again there he was still, with a kind of\nquestion in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to\nsee him.",
        "I wonder I didn\u2019t drop.",
        "I know that everything was turning\nround, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee\nin my ear.",
        "I didn\u2019t know what to do.",
        "Should I stop the service and make\na scene in the church?",
        "I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know\nwhat I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to\nbe still.",
        "Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that\nhe was writing me a note.",
        "As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped\nmy bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he\nreturned me the flowers.",
        "It was only a line asking me to join him when\nhe made the sign to me to do so.",
        "Of course I never doubted for a moment\nthat my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever\nhe might direct.",
        "\u201cWhen I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and\nhad always been his friend.",
        "I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a\nfew things packed and my ulster ready.",
        "I know I ought to have spoken to\nLord St.",
        "Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all\nthose great people.",
        "I just made up my mind to run away and explain\nafterwards.",
        "I hadn\u2019t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank\nout of the window at the other side of the road.",
        "He beckoned to me and\nthen began walking into the Park.",
        "I slipped out, put on my things, and\nfollowed him.",
        "Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St.",
        "Simon to me\u2014seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little\nsecret of his own before marriage also\u2014but I managed to get away from\nher and soon overtook Frank.",
        "We got into a cab together, and away we\ndrove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my\ntrue wedding after all those years of waiting.",
        "Frank had been a\nprisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to \u2019Frisco, found that\nI had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there,\nand had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw it in a paper,\u201d explained the American.",
        "\u201cIt gave the name and\nthe church but not where the lady lived.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for\nopenness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should\nlike to vanish away and never see any of them again\u2014just sending a line\nto Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive.",
        "It was awful to me to\nthink of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table\nand waiting for me to come back.",
        "So Frank took my wedding-clothes and\nthings and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and\ndropped them away somewhere where no one could find them.",
        "It is likely\nthat we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good\ngentleman, Mr.",
        "Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he\nfound us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and\nkindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be\nputting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret.",
        "Then he offered to\ngive us a chance of talking to Lord St.",
        "Simon alone, and so we came\nright away round to his rooms at once.",
        "Now, Robert, you have heard it\nall, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you\ndo not think very meanly of me.\u201d\n\nLord St.",
        "Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had\nlistened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long\nnarrative.",
        "\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it is not my custom to discuss my most\nintimate personal affairs in this public manner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you won\u2019t forgive me?",
        "You won\u2019t shake hands before I go?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.\u201d He put out his hand\nand coldly grasped that which she extended to him.",
        "\u201cI had hoped,\u201d suggested Holmes, \u201cthat you would have joined us in a\nfriendly supper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that there you ask a little too much,\u201d responded his Lordship.",
        "\u201cI may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can\nhardly be expected to make merry over them.",
        "I think that with your\npermission I will now wish you all a very good-night.\u201d He included us\nall in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.",
        "\u201cThen I trust that you at least will honour me with your company,\u201d said\nSherlock Holmes.",
        "\u201cIt is always a joy to meet an American, Mr.",
        "Moulton,\nfor I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the\nblundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our\nchildren from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country\nunder a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the\nStars and Stripes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe case has been an interesting one,\u201d remarked Holmes when our\nvisitors had left us, \u201cbecause it serves to show very clearly how\nsimple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems\nto be almost inexplicable.",
        "Nothing could be more natural than the\nsequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than\nthe result when viewed, for instance, by Mr.",
        "Lestrade of Scotland\nYard.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were not yourself at fault at all, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the\nlady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other\nthat she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.",
        "Obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her\nto change her mind.",
        "What could that something be?",
        "She could not have\nspoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of\nthe bridegroom.",
        "Had she seen someone, then?",
        "If she had, it must be\nsomeone from America because she had spent so short a time in this\ncountry that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an\ninfluence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to\nchange her plans so completely.",
        "You see we have already arrived, by a\nprocess of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an American.",
        "Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so much\ninfluence over her?",
        "It might be a lover; it might be a husband.",
        "Her\nyoung womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under\nstrange conditions.",
        "So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St.",
        "Simon\u2019s narrative.",
        "When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in\nthe bride\u2019s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as\nthe dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and\nof her very significant allusion to claim-jumping\u2014which in miners\u2019\nparlance means taking possession of that which another person has a\nprior claim to\u2014the whole situation became absolutely clear.",
        "She had\ngone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous\nhusband\u2014the chances being in favour of the latter.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how in the world did you find them?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in\nhis hands the value of which he did not himself know.",
        "The initials\nwere, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was\nit to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the\nmost select London hotels.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you deduce the select?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the select prices.",
        "Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a\nglass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels.",
        "There are\nnot many in London which charge at that rate.",
        "In the second one which I\nvisited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the\nbook that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the\nday before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon\nthe very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill.",
        "His letters were\nto be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being\nfortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give\nthem some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be\nbetter in every way that they should make their position a little\nclearer both to the general public and to Lord St.",
        "Simon in particular.",
        "I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the\nappointment.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut with no very good result,\u201d I remarked.",
        "\u201cHis conduct was certainly\nnot very gracious.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, Watson,\u201d said Holmes, smiling, \u201cperhaps you would not be very\ngracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you\nfound yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune.",
        "I think\nthat we may judge Lord St.",
        "Simon very mercifully and thank our stars\nthat we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position.",
        "Draw\nyour chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still\nto solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nXI.",
        "THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET\n\n\n\u201cHolmes,\u201d said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down\nthe street, \u201chere is a madman coming along.",
        "It seems rather sad that\nhis relatives should allow him to come out alone.\u201d\n\nMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the\npockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder.",
        "It was a\nbright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still\nlay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun.",
        "Down\nthe centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly\nband by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of\nthe footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell.",
        "The grey pavement\nhad been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so\nthat there were fewer passengers than usual.",
        "Indeed, from the direction\nof the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman\nwhose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.",
        "He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a\nmassive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure.",
        "He was dressed\nin a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat\nbrown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers.",
        "Yet his actions were\nin absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was\nrunning hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives\nwho is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs.",
        "As he ran he\njerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face\ninto the most extraordinary contortions.",
        "\u201cWhat on earth can be the matter with him?\u201d I asked.",
        "\u201cHe is looking up\nat the numbers of the houses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe that he is coming here,\u201d said Holmes, rubbing his hands.",
        "\u201cHere?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally.",
        "I think\nthat I recognise the symptoms.",
        "Ha!",
        "did I not tell you?\u201d As he spoke,\nthe man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell\nuntil the whole house resounded with the clanging.",
        "A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still\ngesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his\neyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity.",
        "For\na while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked\nat his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his\nreason.",
        "Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against\nthe wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away\nto the centre of the room.",
        "Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the\neasy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with\nhim in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.",
        "\u201cYou have come to me to tell your story, have you not?\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cYou\nare fatigued with your haste.",
        "Pray wait until you have recovered\nyourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little\nproblem which you may submit to me.\u201d\n\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against\nhis emotion.",
        "Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his\nlips tight, and turned his face towards us.",
        "\u201cNo doubt you think me mad?\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cI see that you have had some great trouble,\u201d responded Holmes.",
        "\u201cGod knows I have!\u2014a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so\nsudden and so terrible is it.",
        "Public disgrace I might have faced,\nalthough I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain.",
        "Private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming\ntogether, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very\nsoul.",
        "Besides, it is not I alone.",
        "The very noblest in the land may\nsuffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.\u201d\n\n\u201cPray compose yourself, sir,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cand let me have a clear\naccount of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name,\u201d answered our visitor, \u201cis probably familiar to your ears.",
        "I\nam Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of\nThreadneedle Street.\u201d\n\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner\nin the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.",
        "What could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens\nof London to this most pitiable pass?",
        "We waited, all curiosity, until\nwith another effort he braced himself to tell his story.",
        "\u201cI feel that time is of value,\u201d said he; \u201cthat is why I hastened here\nwhen the police inspector suggested that I should secure your\nco-operation.",
        "I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried\nfrom there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow.",
        "That is\nwhy I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little\nexercise.",
        "I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as\nshortly and yet as clearly as I can.",
        "\u201cIt is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking\nbusiness as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative\ninvestments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the\nnumber of our depositors.",
        "One of our most lucrative means of laying out\nmoney is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable.",
        "We\nhave done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and\nthere are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon\nthe security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.",
        "\u201cYesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card\nwas brought in to me by one of the clerks.",
        "I started when I saw the\nname, for it was that of none other than\u2014well, perhaps even to you I\nhad better say no more than that it was a name which is a household\nword all over the earth\u2014one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names\nin England.",
        "I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he\nentered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air\nof a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.",
        "\u201c\u2018Mr.",
        "Holder,\u2019 said he, \u2018I have been informed that you are in the habit\nof advancing money.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018The firm does so when the security is good.\u2019 I answered.",
        "\u201c\u2018It is absolutely essential to me,\u2019 said he, \u2018that I should have \u00a3\n50,000 at once.",
        "I could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times\nover from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of business\nand to carry out that business myself.",
        "In my position you can readily\nunderstand that it is unwise to place one\u2019s self under obligations.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?\u2019 I asked.",
        "\u201c\u2018Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most\ncertainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it\nright to charge.",
        "But it is very essential to me that the money should\nbe paid at once.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own\nprivate purse,\u2019 said I, \u2018were it not that the strain would be rather\nmore than it could bear.",
        "If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the\nname of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that,\neven in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I should much prefer to have it so,\u2019 said he, raising up a square,\nblack morocco case which he had laid beside his chair.",

        "\u2018There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,\u2019 said he, \u2018and the\nprice of the gold chasing is incalculable.",
        "The lowest estimate would\nput the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked.",
        "I am\nprepared to leave it with you as my security.\u2019\n\n\u201cI took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity\nfrom it to my illustrious client.",

        "Is the security sufficient?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Ample.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018You understand, Mr.",
        "Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of\nthe confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard\nof you.",
        "I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all\ngossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with\nevery possible precaution because I need not say that a great public\nscandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it.",
        "Any injury to it\nwould be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no\nberyls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to\nreplace them.",
        "I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and\nI shall call for it in person on Monday morning.\u2019\n\n\u201cSeeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,\ncalling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty \u00a3 1000 notes.",
        "When I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon\nthe table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of\nthe immense responsibility which it entailed upon me.",
        "There could be no\ndoubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would\nensue if any misfortune should occur to it.",
        "I already regretted having\never consented to take charge of it.",
        "However, it was too late to alter\nthe matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once\nmore to my work.",
        "\u201cWhen evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so\nprecious a thing in the office behind me.",
        "Bankers\u2019 safes had been\nforced before now, and why should not mine be?",
        "If so, how terrible\nwould be the position in which I should find myself!",
        "I determined,\ntherefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case\nbackward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of\nmy reach.",
        "With this intention, I called a cab and drove out to my house\nat Streatham, carrying the jewel with me.",
        "I did not breathe freely\nuntil I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my\ndressing-room.",
        "\u201cAnd now a word as to my household, Mr.",
        "Holmes, for I wish you to\nthoroughly understand the situation.",
        "My groom and my page sleep out of\nthe house, and may be set aside altogether.",
        "I have three maid-servants\nwho have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability\nis quite above suspicion.",
        "Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid,\nhas only been in my service a few months.",
        "She came with an excellent\ncharacter, however, and has always given me satisfaction.",
        "She is a very\npretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about\nthe place.",
        "That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we\nbelieve her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.",
        "\u201cSo much for the servants.",
        "My family itself is so small that it will\nnot take me long to describe it.",
        "I am a widower and have an only son,\nArthur.",
        "He has been a disappointment to me, Mr.",
        "Holmes\u2014a grievous\ndisappointment.",
        "I have no doubt that I am myself to blame.",
        "People tell\nme that I have spoiled him.",
        "Very likely I have.",
        "When my dear wife died\nI felt that he was all I had to love.",
        "I could not bear to see the smile\nfade even for a moment from his face.",
        "I have never denied him a wish.",
        "Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner,\nbut I meant it for the best.",
        "\u201cIt was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my\nbusiness, but he was not of a business turn.",
        "He was wild, wayward, and,\nto speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large sums\nof money.",
        "When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club,\nand there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a\nnumber of men with long purses and expensive habits.",
        "He learned to play\nheavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again\nand again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his\nallowance, that he might settle his debts of honour.",
        "He tried more than\nonce to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but\neach time the influence of his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough\nto draw him back again.",
        "\u201cAnd, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell\nshould gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to\nmy house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the\nfascination of his manner.",
        "He is older than Arthur, a man of the world\nto his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a\nbrilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty.",
        "Yet when I think\nof him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am\nconvinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in\nhis eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted.",
        "So I think,\nand so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman\u2019s quick insight\ninto character.",
        "\u201cAnd now there is only she to be described.",
        "She is my niece; but when\nmy brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I\nadopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter.",
        "She is\na sunbeam in my house\u2014sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and\nhousekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be.",
        "She is my right hand.",
        "I do not know what I could do without her.",
        "In\nonly one matter has she ever gone against my wishes.",
        "Twice my boy has\nasked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she\nhas refused him.",
        "I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the\nright path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have\nchanged his whole life; but now, alas!",
        "it is too late\u2014forever too late!",
        "\u201cNow, Mr.",
        "Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I\nshall continue with my miserable story.",
        "\u201cWhen we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after\ndinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious\ntreasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my\nclient.",
        "Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left\nthe room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.",
        "Mary and Arthur\nwere much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but I\nthought it better not to disturb it.",
        "\u201c\u2018Where have you put it?\u2019 asked Arthur.",
        "\u201c\u2018In my own bureau.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Well, I hope to goodness the house won\u2019t be burgled during the\nnight.\u2019 said he.",
        "\u201c\u2018It is locked up,\u2019 I answered.",
        "\u201c\u2018Oh, any old key will fit that bureau.",
        "When I was a youngster I have\nopened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what\nhe said.",
        "He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very\ngrave face.",
        "\u201c\u2018Look here, dad,\u2019 said he with his eyes cast down, \u2018can you let me\nhave \u00a3 200?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No, I cannot!\u2019 I answered sharply.",
        "\u2018I have been far too generous with\nyou in money matters.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018You have been very kind,\u2019 said he, \u2018but I must have this money, or\nelse I can never show my face inside the club again.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018And a very good thing, too!\u2019 I cried.",
        "\u201c\u2018Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,\u2019 said he.",
        "\u2018I could not bear the disgrace.",
        "I must raise the money in some way, and\nif you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month.",
        "\u2018You\nshall not have a farthing from me,\u2019 I cried, on which he bowed and left\nthe room without another word.",
        "\u201cWhen he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was\nsafe, and locked it again.",
        "Then I started to go round the house to see\nthat all was secure\u2014a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I\nthought it well to perform myself that night.",
        "As I came down the stairs\nI saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and\nfastened as I approached.",
        "\u201c\u2018Tell me, dad,\u2019 said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, \u2018did\nyou give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Certainly not.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018She came in just now by the back door.",
        "I have no doubt that she has\nonly been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that it is\nhardly safe and should be stopped.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer it.",
        "Are\nyou sure that everything is fastened?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Quite sure, dad.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Then, good-night.\u2019 I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again,\nwhere I was soon asleep.",
        "\u201cI am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr.",
        "Holmes, which may have\nany bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any\npoint which I do not make clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be\nparticularly so.",
        "I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my\nmind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual.",
        "About two in\nthe morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house.",
        "It had\nceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as\nthough a window had gently closed somewhere.",
        "I lay listening with all\nmy ears.",
        "Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of\nfootsteps moving softly in the next room.",
        "I slipped out of bed, all\npalpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room\ndoor.",
        "\u201c\u2018Arthur!\u2019 I screamed, \u2018you villain!",
        "you thief!",
        "How dare you touch that\ncoronet?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed\nonly in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding\nthe coronet in his hands.",
        "He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending\nit with all his strength.",
        "At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and\nturned as pale as death.",
        "I snatched it up and examined it.",
        "One of the\ngold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.",
        "\u201c\u2018You blackguard!\u2019 I shouted, beside myself with rage.",
        "\u2018You have\ndestroyed it!",
        "You have dishonoured me forever!",
        "Where are the jewels\nwhich you have stolen?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Stolen!\u2019 he cried.",
        "\u201c\u2018Yes, thief!\u2019 I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.",
        "\u201c\u2018There are none missing.",
        "There cannot be any missing,\u2019 said he.",
        "\u201c\u2018There are three missing.",
        "And you know where they are.",
        "Must I call you\na liar as well as a thief?",
        "Did I not see you trying to tear off another\npiece?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018You have called me names enough,\u2019 said he, \u2018I will not stand it any\nlonger.",
        "I shall not say another word about this business, since you\nhave chosen to insult me.",
        "I will leave your house in the morning and\nmake my own way in the world.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018You shall leave it in the hands of the police!\u2019 I cried half-mad with\ngrief and rage.",
        "\u2018I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018You shall learn nothing from me,\u2019 said he with a passion such as I\nshould not have thought was in his nature.",
        "\u2018If you choose to call the\npolice, let the police find what they can.\u2019\n\n\u201cBy this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in\nmy anger.",
        "Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of\nthe coronet and of Arthur\u2019s face, she read the whole story and, with a\nscream, fell down senseless on the ground.",
        "I sent the housemaid for the\npolice and put the investigation into their hands at once.",
        "When the\ninspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood\nsullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to\ncharge him with theft.",
        "I answered that it had ceased to be a private\nmatter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was\nnational property.",
        "I was determined that the law should have its way in\neverything.",
        "\u201c\u2018At least,\u2019 said he, \u2018you will not have me arrested at once.",
        "It would\nbe to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for\nfive minutes.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have\nstolen,\u2019 said I. And then, realising the dreadful position in which I\nwas placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that\nof one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened\nto raise a scandal which would convulse the nation.",
        "He might avert it\nall if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing\nstones.",
        "\u201c\u2018You may as well face the matter,\u2019 said I; \u2018you have been caught in\nthe act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous.",
        "If you\nbut make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the\nberyls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,\u2019 he answered, turning\naway from me with a sneer.",
        "I saw that he was too hardened for any words\nof mine to influence him.",
        "There was but one way for it.",
        "I called in the\ninspector and gave him into custody.",
        "A search was made at once not only\nof his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where\nhe could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could\nbe found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our\npersuasions and our threats.",
        "This morning he was removed to a cell, and\nI, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round\nto you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter.",
        "The\npolice have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of\nit.",
        "You may go to any expense which you think necessary.",
        "I have already\noffered a reward of \u00a3 1000.",
        "My God, what shall I do!",
        "I have lost my\nhonour, my gems, and my son in one night.",
        "Oh, what shall I do!\u201d\n\nHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro,\ndroning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.",
        "Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted\nand his eyes fixed upon the fire.",
        "\u201cDo you receive much company?\u201d he asked.",
        "\u201cNone save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of\nArthur\u2019s.",
        "Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately.",
        "No one\nelse, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you go out much in society?\u201d\n\n\u201cArthur does.",
        "Mary and I stay at home.",
        "We neither of us care for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is unusual in a young girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is of a quiet nature.",
        "Besides, she is not so very young.",
        "She is\nfour-and-twenty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her\nalso.\u201d\n\n\u201cTerrible!",
        "She is even more affected than I.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have neither of you any doubt as to your son\u2019s guilt?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in\nhis hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hardly consider that a conclusive proof.",
        "Was the remainder of the\ncoronet at all injured?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it was twisted.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten\nit?\u201d\n\n\u201cGod bless you!",
        "You are doing what you can for him and for me.",
        "But it\nis too heavy a task.",
        "What was he doing there at all?",
        "If his purpose\nwere innocent, why did he not say so?\u201d\n\n\u201cPrecisely.",
        "And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?",
        "His\nsilence appears to me to cut both ways.",
        "There are several singular\npoints about the case.",
        "What did the police think of the noise which\nawoke you from your sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey considered that it might be caused by Arthur\u2019s closing his\nbedroom door.\u201d\n\n\u201cA likely story!",
        "As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as\nto wake a household.",
        "What did they say, then, of the disappearance of\nthese gems?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the\nhope of finding them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave they thought of looking outside the house?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, they have shown extraordinary energy.",
        "The whole garden has\nalready been minutely examined.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, my dear sir,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cis it not obvious to you now that\nthis matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the\npolice were at first inclined to think?",
        "It appeared to you to be a\nsimple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex.",
        "Consider what is\ninvolved by your theory.",
        "You suppose that your son came down from his\nbed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau,\ntook out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it,\nwent off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the\nthirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then\nreturned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed\nhimself to the greatest danger of being discovered.",
        "I ask you now, is\nsuch a theory tenable?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what other is there?\u201d cried the banker with a gesture of despair.",
        "\u201cIf his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is our task to find that out,\u201d replied Holmes; \u201cso now, if you\nplease, Mr.",
        "Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote\nan hour to glancing a little more closely into details.\u201d\n\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which\nI was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply\nstirred by the story to which we had listened.",
        "I confess that the guilt\nof the banker\u2019s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his\nunhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes\u2019 judgment that I\nfelt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was\ndissatisfied with the accepted explanation.",
        "He hardly spoke a word the\nwhole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his\nbreast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.",
        "Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of\nhope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a\ndesultory chat with me over his business affairs.",
        "A short railway\njourney and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence\nof the great financier.",
        "Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a\nlittle from the road.",
        "A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,\nstretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the\nentrance.",
        "On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into\na narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the\nkitchen door, and forming the tradesmen\u2019s entrance.",
        "On the left ran a\nlane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at\nall, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare.",
        "Holmes left us\nstanding at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the\nfront, down the tradesmen\u2019s path, and so round by the garden behind\ninto the stable lane.",
        "So long was he that Mr.",
        "Holder and I went into\nthe dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return.",
        "We were\nsitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.",
        "She was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,\nwhich seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin.",
        "I do\nnot think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman\u2019s face.",
        "Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.",
        "As she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater\nsense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the\nmore striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,\nwith immense capacity for self-restraint.",
        "Disregarding my presence, she\nwent straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a\nsweet womanly caress.",
        "\u201cYou have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,\ndad?\u201d she asked.",
        "\u201cNo, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am so sure that he is innocent.",
        "You know what woman\u2019s instincts\nare.",
        "I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for\nhaving acted so harshly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is he silent, then, if he is innocent?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho knows?",
        "Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect\nhim.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\ncoronet in his hand?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, but he had only picked it up to look at it.",
        "Oh, do, do take my\nword for it that he is innocent.",
        "Let the matter drop and say no more.",
        "It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall never let it drop until the gems are found\u2014never, Mary!",
        "Your\naffection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me.",
        "Far\nfrom hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London\nto inquire more deeply into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis gentleman?\u201d she asked, facing round to me.",
        "\u201cNo, his friend.",
        "He wished us to leave him alone.",
        "He is round in the\nstable lane now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe stable lane?\u201d She raised her dark eyebrows.",
        "\u201cWhat can he hope to\nfind there?",
        "Ah!",
        "this, I suppose, is he.",
        "I trust, sir, that you will\nsucceed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin\nArthur is innocent of this crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove\nit,\u201d returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his\nshoes.",
        "\u201cI believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder.",
        "Might I ask you a question or two?\u201d\n\n\u201cPray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou heard nothing yourself last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly.",
        "I heard that, and\nI came down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shut up the windows and doors the night before.",
        "Did you fasten all\nthe windows?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere they all fastened this morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a maid who has a sweetheart?",
        "I think that you remarked to\nyour uncle last night that she had been out to see him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may\nhave heard uncle\u2019s remarks about the coronet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.",
        "You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,\nand that the two may have planned the robbery.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what is the good of all these vague theories,\u201d cried the banker\nimpatiently, \u201cwhen I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet\nin his hands?\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a little, Mr.",
        "Holder.",
        "We must come back to that.",
        "About this girl,\nMiss Holder.",
        "You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met\nher slipping in.",
        "I saw the man, too, in the gloom.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes!",
        "he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round.",
        "His\nname is Francis Prosper.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe stood,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cto the left of the door\u2014that is to say,\nfarther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he did.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he is a man with a wooden leg?\u201d\n\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady\u2019s expressive black\neyes.",
        "\u201cWhy, you are like a magician,\u201d said she.",
        "\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\nShe smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes\u2019 thin, eager\nface.",
        "\u201cI should be very glad now to go upstairs,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cI shall probably\nwish to go over the outside of the house again.",
        "Perhaps I had better\ntake a look at the lower windows before I go up.\u201d\n\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the\nlarge one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.",
        "This he\nopened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his\npowerful magnifying lens.",
        "\u201cNow we shall go upstairs,\u201d said he at last.",
        "The banker\u2019s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with\na grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror.",
        "Holmes went to the\nbureau first and looked hard at the lock.",
        "\u201cWhich key was used to open it?\u201d he asked.",
        "\u201cThat which my son himself indicated\u2014that of the cupboard of the\nlumber-room.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you it here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is it on the dressing-table.\u201d\n\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.",
        "\u201cIt is a noiseless lock,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cIt is no wonder that it did not\nwake you.",
        "This case, I presume, contains the coronet.",
        "We must have a\nlook at it.\u201d He opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it\nupon the table.",
        "It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller\u2019s art,\nand the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen.",
        "At one\nside of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three\ngems had been torn away.",
        "\u201cNow, Mr.",
        "Holder,\u201d said Holmes, \u201chere is the corner which corresponds\nto that which has been so unfortunately lost.",
        "Might I beg that you will\nbreak it off.\u201d\n\nThe banker recoiled in horror.",
        "\u201cI should not dream of trying,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cThen I will.\u201d Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without\nresult.",
        "\u201cI feel it give a little,\u201d said he; \u201cbut, though I am\nexceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to\nbreak it.",
        "An ordinary man could not do it.",
        "Now, what do you think would\nhappen if I did break it, Mr.",
        "Holder?",
        "There would be a noise like a\npistol shot.",
        "Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards\nof your bed and that you heard nothing of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know what to think.",
        "It is all dark to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut perhaps it may grow lighter as we go.",
        "What do you think, Miss\nHolder?\u201d\n\n\u201cI confess that I still share my uncle\u2019s perplexity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.",
        "We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck\nduring this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not\nsucceed in clearing the matter up.",
        "With your permission, Mr.",
        "Holder, I\nshall now continue my investigations outside.\u201d\n\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any\nunnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult.",
        "For an hour\nor more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow\nand his features as inscrutable as ever.",
        "\u201cI think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.",
        "Holder,\u201d\nsaid he; \u201cI can serve you best by returning to my rooms.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the gems, Mr.",
        "Holmes.",
        "Where are they?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot tell.\u201d\n\nThe banker wrung his hands.",
        "\u201cI shall never see them again!\u201d he cried.",
        "\u201cAnd my son?",
        "You give me hopes?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy opinion is in no way altered.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, for God\u2019s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in\nmy house last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning\nbetween nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it\nclearer.",
        "I understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you,\nprovided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on\nthe sum I may draw.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would give my fortune to have them back.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good.",
        "I shall look into the matter between this and then.",
        "Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again\nbefore evening.\u201d\n\nIt was obvious to me that my companion\u2019s mind was now made up about the\ncase, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even\ndimly imagine.",
        "Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured\nto sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other\ntopic, until at last I gave it over in despair.",
        "It was not yet three\nwhen we found ourselves in our rooms once more.",
        "He hurried to his\nchamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer.",
        "With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and\nhis worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.",
        "\u201cI think that this should do,\u201d said he, glancing into the glass above\nthe fireplace.",
        "\u201cI only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but I\nfear that it won\u2019t do.",
        "I may be on the trail in this matter, or I may\nbe following a will-o\u2019-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it is.",
        "I\nhope that I may be back in a few hours.\u201d He cut a slice of beef from\nthe joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of\nbread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon\nhis expedition.",
        "I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent\nspirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand.",
        "He chucked it\ndown into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.",
        "\u201cI only looked in as I passed,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cI am going right on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, to the other side of the West End.",
        "It may be some time before I\nget back.",
        "Don\u2019t wait up for me in case I should be late.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow are you getting on?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, so so.",
        "Nothing to complain of.",
        "I have been out to Streatham since\nI saw you last, but I did not call at the house.",
        "It is a very sweet\nlittle problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.",
        "However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable\nclothes off and return to my highly respectable self.\u201d\n\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction\nthan his words alone would imply.",
        "His eyes twinkled, and there was even\na touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks.",
        "He hastened upstairs, and a\nfew minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that\nhe was off once more upon his congenial hunt.",
        "I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I\nretired to my room.",
        "It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for\ndays and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his\nlateness caused me no surprise.",
        "I do not know at what hour he came in,\nbut when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a\ncup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim\nas possible.",
        "\u201cYou will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cbut you\nremember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, it is after nine now,\u201d I answered.",
        "\u201cI should not be surprised if\nthat were he.",
        "I thought I heard a ring.\u201d\n\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier.",
        "I was shocked by the change\nwhich had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad\nand massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed\nto me at least a shade whiter.",
        "He entered with a weariness and lethargy\nwhich was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,\nand he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for\nhim.",
        "\u201cI do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cOnly two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in\nthe world.",
        "Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age.",
        "One sorrow\ncomes close upon the heels of another.",
        "My niece, Mary, has deserted\nme.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeserted you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.",
        "Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,\nand a note for me lay upon the hall table.",
        "I had said to her last\nnight, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all\nmight have been well with him.",
        "Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say\nso.",
        "It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\n\n    \u201c\u2018MY DEAREST UNCLE,\u2014I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,\n    and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might\n    never have occurred.",
        "I cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever\n    again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must leave you\n    forever.",
        "Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for;\n    and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless\n    labour and an ill-service to me.",
        "In life or in death, I am ever\n    your loving,\n\n\n    \u201c\u2018MARY.\u2019\n\n\n\u201cWhat could she mean by that note, Mr.",
        "Holmes?",
        "Do you think it points\nto suicide?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, nothing of the kind.",
        "It is perhaps the best possible solution.",
        "I trust, Mr.",
        "Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa!",
        "You say so!",
        "You have heard something, Mr.",
        "Holmes; you have learned\nsomething!",
        "Where are the gems?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would not think \u00a3 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would pay ten.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be unnecessary.",
        "Three thousand will cover the matter.",
        "And\nthere is a little reward, I fancy.",
        "Have you your cheque-book?",
        "Here is a\npen.",
        "Better make it out for \u00a3 4000.\u201d\n\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check.",
        "Holmes walked\nover to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three\ngems in it, and threw it down upon the table.",
        "With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.",
        "\u201cYou have it!\u201d he gasped.",
        "\u201cI am saved!",
        "I am saved!\u201d\n\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he\nhugged his recovered gems to his bosom.",
        "\u201cThere is one other thing you owe, Mr.",
        "Holder,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes\nrather sternly.",
        "\u201cOwe!\u201d He caught up a pen.",
        "\u201cName the sum, and I will pay it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, the debt is not to me.",
        "You owe a very humble apology to that noble\nlad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be\nproud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it was not Arthur who took them?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are sure of it!",
        "Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know\nthat the truth is known.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knows it already.",
        "When I had cleared it all up I had an interview\nwith him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it to\nhim, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very\nfew details which were not yet quite clear to me.",
        "Your news of this\nmorning, however, may open his lips.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Heaven\u2019s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it.",
        "And\nlet me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and\nfor you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George\nBurnwell and your niece Mary.",
        "They have now fled together.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Mary?",
        "Impossible!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain.",
        "Neither you nor\nyour son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into\nyour family circle.",
        "He is one of the most dangerous men in England\u2014a\nruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or\nconscience.",
        "Your niece knew nothing of such men.",
        "When he breathed his\nvows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered\nherself that she alone had touched his heart.",
        "The devil knows best what\nhe said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of\nseeing him nearly every evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot, and I will not, believe it!\u201d cried the banker with an ashen\nface.",
        "\u201cI will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.",
        "Your\nniece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down\nand talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable\nlane.",
        "His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he\nstood there.",
        "She told him of the coronet.",
        "His wicked lust for gold\nkindled at the news, and he bent her to his will.",
        "I have no doubt that\nshe loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover\nextinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.",
        "She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\ndownstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about\none of the servants\u2019 escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was\nall perfectly true.",
        "\u201cYour boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he\nslept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.",
        "In the\nmiddle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose\nand, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very\nstealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your\ndressing-room.",
        "Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some\nclothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this\nstrange affair.",
        "Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the\nlight of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious\ncoronet in her hands.",
        "She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling\nwith horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door,\nwhence he could see what passed in the hall beneath.",
        "He saw her\nstealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the\ngloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing\nquite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.",
        "\u201cAs long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a\nhorrible exposure of the woman whom he loved.",
        "But the instant that she\nwas gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you,\nand how all-important it was to set it right.",
        "He rushed down, just as\nhe was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow,\nand ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the\nmoonlight.",
        "Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught\nhim, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one\nside of the coronet, and his opponent at the other.",
        "In the scuffle,\nyour son struck Sir George and cut him over the eye.",
        "Then something\nsuddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his\nhands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had\njust observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was\nendeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it possible?\u201d gasped the banker.",
        "\u201cYou then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he\nfelt that he had deserved your warmest thanks.",
        "He could not explain the\ntrue state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved\nlittle enough consideration at his hands.",
        "He took the more chivalrous\nview, however, and preserved her secret.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,\u201d\ncried Mr.",
        "Holder.",
        "\u201cOh, my God!",
        "what a blind fool I have been!",
        "And his\nasking to be allowed to go out for five minutes!",
        "The dear fellow wanted\nto see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle.",
        "How\ncruelly I have misjudged him!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived at the house,\u201d continued Holmes, \u201cI at once went very\ncarefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow\nwhich might help me.",
        "I knew that none had fallen since the evening\nbefore, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve\nimpressions.",
        "I passed along the tradesmen\u2019s path, but found it all\ntrampled down and indistinguishable.",
        "Just beyond it, however, at the\nfar side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,\nwhose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg.",
        "I\ncould even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run\nback swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel\nmarks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away.",
        "I\nthought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of\nwhom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so.",
        "I\npassed round the garden without seeing anything more than random\ntracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable\nlane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of\nme.",
        "\u201cThere was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\nline which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet.",
        "I was\nat once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your\nson.",
        "The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and\nas his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it\nwas obvious that he had passed after the other.",
        "I followed them up and\nfound they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow\naway while waiting.",
        "Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred\nyards or more down the lane.",
        "I saw where Boots had faced round, where\nthe snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally,\nwhere a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I was not\nmistaken.",
        "Boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge\nof blood showed that it was he who had been hurt.",
        "When he came to the\nhigh road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been cleared,\nso there was an end to that clue.",
        "\u201cOn entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill\nand framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once see\nthat someone had passed out.",
        "I could distinguish the outline of an\ninstep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in.",
        "I was then\nbeginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred.",
        "A man\nhad waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed\nhad been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled\nwith him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength\ncausing injuries which neither alone could have effected.",
        "He had\nreturned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his\nopponent.",
        "So far I was clear.",
        "The question now was, who was the man, and\nwho was it brought him the coronet?",
        "\u201cIt is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,\nwhatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.",
        "Now, I knew\nthat it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained\nyour niece and the maids.",
        "But if it were the maids, why should your son\nallow himself to be accused in their place?",
        "There could be no possible\nreason.",
        "As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent\nexplanation why he should retain her secret\u2014the more so as the secret\nwas a disgraceful one.",
        "When I remembered that you had seen her at that\nwindow, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my\nconjecture became a certainty.",
        "\u201cAnd who could it be who was her confederate?",
        "A lover evidently, for\nwho else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to\nyou?",
        "I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends\nwas a very limited one.",
        "But among them was Sir George Burnwell.",
        "I had\nheard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women.",
        "It\nmust have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.",
        "Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still\nflatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word\nwithout compromising his own family.",
        "\u201cWell, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next.",
        "I\nwent in the shape of a loafer to Sir George\u2019s house, managed to pick up\nan acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his\nhead the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings,\nmade all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes.",
        "With these I\njourneyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the\ntracks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Holder.",
        "\u201cPrecisely.",
        "It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and\nchanged my clothes.",
        "It was a delicate part which I had to play then,\nfor I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I\nknew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the\nmatter.",
        "I went and saw him.",
        "At first, of course, he denied everything.",
        "But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to\nbluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall.",
        "I knew my man,\nhowever, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.",
        "Then he became a little more reasonable.",
        "I told him that we would give\nhim a price for the stones he held\u2014\u00a3 1000 apiece.",
        "That brought out the\nfirst signs of grief that he had shown.",
        "\u2018Why, dash it all!\u2019 said he,\n\u2018I\u2019ve let them go at six hundred for the three!\u2019 I soon managed to get\nthe address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there\nwould be no prosecution.",
        "Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I\ngot our stones at \u00a3 1000 apiece.",
        "Then I looked in upon your son, told\nhim that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o\u2019clock,\nafter what I may call a really hard day\u2019s work.\u201d\n\n\u201cA day which has saved England from a great public scandal,\u201d said the\nbanker, rising.",
        "\u201cSir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall\nnot find me ungrateful for what you have done.",
        "Your skill has indeed\nexceeded all that I have heard of it.",
        "And now I must fly to my dear boy\nto apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him.",
        "As to what you\ntell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart.",
        "Not even your skill can\ninform me where she is now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that we may safely say,\u201d returned Holmes, \u201cthat she is\nwherever Sir George Burnwell is.",
        "It is equally certain, too, that\nwhatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient\npunishment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nXII.",
        "THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES\n\n\n\u201cTo the man who loves art for its own sake,\u201d remarked Sherlock Holmes,\ntossing aside the advertisement sheet of _The Daily Telegraph_, \u201cit is\nfrequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the\nkeenest pleasure is to be derived.",
        "It is pleasant to me to observe,\nWatson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little\nrecords of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I\nam bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence\nnot so much to the many _causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres_ and sensational trials in\nwhich I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been\ntrivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of\ndeduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special\nprovince.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d said I, smiling, \u201cI cannot quite hold myself absolved from\nthe charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have erred, perhaps,\u201d he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with\nthe tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont\nto replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a\nmeditative mood\u2014\u201cyou have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and\nlife into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the\ntask of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect\nwhich is really the only notable feature about the thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,\u201d I\nremarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which I\nhad more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend\u2019s\nsingular character.",
        "\u201cNo, it is not selfishness or conceit,\u201d said he, answering, as was his\nwont, my thoughts rather than my words.",
        "\u201cIf I claim full justice for my\nart, it is because it is an impersonal thing\u2014a thing beyond myself.",
        "Crime is common.",
        "Logic is rare.",
        "Therefore it is upon the logic rather\nthan upon the crime that you should dwell.",
        "You have degraded what\nshould have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.\u201d\n\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast\non either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street.",
        "A\nthick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the\nopposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy\nyellow wreaths.",
        "Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and\nglimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.",
        "Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously\ninto the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,\nhaving apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet\ntemper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.",
        "\u201cAt the same time,\u201d he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat\npuffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, \u201cyou can hardly\nbe open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you\nhave been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not\ntreat of crime, in its legal sense, at all.",
        "The small matter in which I\nendeavoured to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of\nMiss Mary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the\ntwisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters\nwhich are outside the pale of the law.",
        "But in avoiding the sensational,\nI fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe end may have been so,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut the methods I hold to have\nbeen novel and of interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cPshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant\npublic, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by\nhis left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!",
        "But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of\nthe great cases are past.",
        "Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all\nenterprise and originality.",
        "As to my own little practice, it seems to\nbe degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and\ngiving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools.",
        "I think that I\nhave touched bottom at last, however.",
        "This note I had this morning\nmarks my zero-point, I fancy.",
        "Read it!\u201d He tossed a crumpled letter\nacross to me.",
        "It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran\nthus:\n\n    \u201cDEAR MR.",
        "HOLMES,\u2014I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I\n    should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to\n    me as governess.",
        "I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do\n    not inconvenience you.",
        "Yours faithfully,\n\n\n    \u201cVIOLET HUNTER.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDo you know the young lady?\u201d I asked.",
        "\u201cNot I.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is half-past ten now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may turn out to be of more interest than you think.",
        "You remember\nthat the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim\nat first, developed into a serious investigation.",
        "It may be so in this\ncase, also.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, let us hope so.",
        "But our doubts will very soon be solved, for\nhere, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.",
        "She was\nplainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a\nplover\u2019s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own\nway to make in the world.",
        "\u201cYou will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,\u201d said she, as my\ncompanion rose to greet her, \u201cbut I have had a very strange experience,\nand as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask\nadvice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what\nI should do.\u201d\n\n\u201cPray take a seat, Miss Hunter.",
        "I shall be happy to do anything that I\ncan to serve you.\u201d\n\nI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and\nspeech of his new client.",
        "He looked her over in his searching fashion,\nand then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips\ntogether, to listen to her story.",
        "\u201cI have been a governess for five years,\u201d said she, \u201cin the family of\nColonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an\nappointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over to\nAmerica with him, so that I found myself without a situation.",
        "I\nadvertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success.",
        "At last\nthe little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my\nwit\u2019s end as to what I should do.",
        "\u201cThere is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called\nWestaway\u2019s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to see\nwhether anything had turned up which might suit me.",
        "Westaway was the\nname of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by Miss\nStoper.",
        "She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are\nseeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by\none, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything\nwhich would suit them.",
        "\u201cWell, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as\nusual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone.",
        "A prodigiously stout\nman with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down\nin fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of\nglasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.",
        "As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to\nMiss Stoper.",
        "\u201c\u2018That will do,\u2019 said he; \u2018I could not ask for anything better.",
        "Capital!",
        "capital!\u2019 He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands\ntogether in the most genial fashion.",
        "He was such a comfortable-looking\nman that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.",
        "\u201c\u2018You are looking for a situation, miss?\u2019 he asked.",
        "\u201c\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018As governess?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018And what salary do you ask?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I had \u00a3 4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh, tut, tut!",
        "sweating\u2014rank sweating!\u2019 he cried, throwing his fat\nhands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion.",
        "\u2018How\ncould anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and\naccomplishments?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,\u2019 said I.",
        "\u2018A\nlittle French, a little German, music, and drawing\u2014\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Tut, tut!\u2019 he cried.",
        "\u2018This is all quite beside the question.",
        "The\npoint is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a\nlady?",
        "There it is in a nutshell.",
        "If you have not, you are not fitted\nfor the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in\nthe history of the country.",
        "But if you have, why, then, how could any\ngentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three\nfigures?",
        "Your salary with me, madam, would commence at \u00a3 100 a year.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou may imagine, Mr.",
        "Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an\noffer seemed almost too good to be true.",
        "The gentleman, however, seeing\nperhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and\ntook out a note.",
        "\u201c\u2018It is also my custom,\u2019 said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion\nuntil his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white\ncreases of his face, \u2018to advance to my young ladies half their salary\nbeforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey\nand their wardrobe.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful\na man.",
        "As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a\ngreat convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the\nwhole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I\nquite committed myself.",
        "\u201c\u2018May I ask where you live, sir?\u2019 said I.",
        "\u201c\u2018Hampshire.",
        "Charming rural place.",
        "The Copper Beeches, five miles on\nthe far side of Winchester.",
        "It is the most lovely country, my dear\nyoung lady, and the dearest old country-house.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018And my duties, sir?",
        "I should be glad to know what they would be.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018One child\u2014one dear little romper just six years old.",
        "Oh, if you could\nsee him killing cockroaches with a slipper!",
        "Smack!",
        "smack!",
        "smack!",
        "Three\ngone before you could wink!\u2019 He leaned back in his chair and laughed\nhis eyes into his head again.",
        "\u201cI was a little startled at the nature of the child\u2019s amusement, but\nthe father\u2019s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.",
        "\u201c\u2018My sole duties, then,\u2019 I asked, \u2018are to take charge of a single\nchild?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,\u2019 he cried.",
        "\u2018Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to\nobey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they\nwere such commands as a lady might with propriety obey.",
        "You see no\ndifficulty, heh?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I should be happy to make myself useful.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Quite so.",
        "In dress now, for example.",
        "We are faddy people, you\nknow\u2014faddy but kind-hearted.",
        "If you were asked to wear any dress which\nwe might give you, you would not object to our little whim.",
        "Heh?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No,\u2019 said I, considerably astonished at his words.",
        "\u201c\u2018Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh, no.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?\u2019\n\n\u201cI could hardly believe my ears.",
        "As you may observe, Mr.",
        "Holmes, my\nhair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.",
        "It has been considered artistic.",
        "I could not dream of sacrificing it in\nthis offhand fashion.",
        "\u201c\u2018I am afraid that that is quite impossible,\u2019 said I. He had been\nwatching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow\npass over his face as I spoke.",
        "\u201c\u2018I am afraid that it is quite essential,\u2019 said he.",
        "\u2018It is a little\nfancy of my wife\u2019s, and ladies\u2019 fancies, you know, madam, ladies\u2019\nfancies must be consulted.",
        "And so you won\u2019t cut your hair?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No, sir, I really could not,\u2019 I answered firmly.",
        "\u201c\u2018Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter.",
        "It is a pity,\nbecause in other respects you would really have done very nicely.",
        "In\nthat case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young\nladies.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a\nword to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance\nupon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a\nhandsome commission through my refusal.",
        "\u201c\u2018Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?\u2019 she asked.",
        "\u201c\u2018If you please, Miss Stoper.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most\nexcellent offers in this fashion,\u2019 said she sharply.",
        "\u2018You can hardly\nexpect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.",
        "Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.\u2019 She struck a gong upon the table, and I\nwas shown out by the page.",
        "\u201cWell, Mr.",
        "Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little\nenough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began\nto ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing.",
        "After all,\nif these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most\nextraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their\neccentricity.",
        "Very few governesses in England are getting \u00a3 100 a year.",
        "Besides, what use was my hair to me?",
        "Many people are improved by\nwearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number.",
        "Next day I\nwas inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after I\nwas sure of it.",
        "I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to\nthe agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received\nthis letter from the gentleman himself.",
        "I have it here and I will read\nit to you:\n\n\u201c\u2018The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.",
        "\u201c\u2018DEAR MISS HUNTER,\u2014Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your\n    address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have\n    reconsidered your decision.",
        "My wife is very anxious that you should\n    come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you.",
        "We\n    are willing to give \u00a3 30 a quarter, or \u00a3 120 a year, so as to\n    recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may\n    cause you.",
        "They are not very exacting, after all.",
        "My wife is fond\n    of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear\n    such a dress indoors in the morning.",
        "You need not, however, go to\n    the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear\n    daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think,\n    fit you very well.",
        "Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing\n    yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no\n    inconvenience.",
        "As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity,\n    especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our\n    short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this\n    point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you\n    for the loss.",
        "Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are\n    very light.",
        "Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the\n    dog-cart at Winchester.",
        "Let me know your train.",
        "Yours faithfully,\n\n\n    \u201c\u2018JEPHRO RUCASTLE.\u2019\n\n\n\u201cThat is the letter which I have just received, Mr.",
        "Holmes, and my mind\nis made up that I will accept it.",
        "I thought, however, that before\ntaking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your\nconsideration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the\nquestion,\u201d said Holmes, smiling.",
        "\u201cBut you would not advise me to refuse?\u201d\n\n\u201cI confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a\nsister of mine apply for.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of it all, Mr.",
        "Holmes?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, I have no data.",
        "I cannot tell.",
        "Perhaps you have yourself formed\nsome opinion?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, there seems to me to be only one possible solution.",
        "Mr.",
        "Rucastle\nseemed to be a very kind, good-natured man.",
        "Is it not possible that his\nwife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear\nshe should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in\nevery way in order to prevent an outbreak?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a possible solution\u2014in fact, as matters stand, it is the most\nprobable one.",
        "But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household\nfor a young lady.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the money, Mr.",
        "Holmes, the money!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes, of course the pay is good\u2014too good.",
        "That is what makes me\nuneasy.",
        "Why should they give you \u00a3 120 a year, when they could have\ntheir pick for \u00a3 40?",
        "There must be some strong reason behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand\nafterwards if I wanted your help.",
        "I should feel so much stronger if I\nfelt that you were at the back of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you may carry that feeling away with you.",
        "I assure you that your\nlittle problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my\nway for some months.",
        "There is something distinctly novel about some of\nthe features.",
        "If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDanger!",
        "What danger do you foresee?\u201d\n\nHolmes shook his head gravely.",
        "\u201cIt would cease to be a danger if we\ncould define it,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cBut at any time, day or night, a telegram\nwould bring me down to your help.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is enough.\u201d She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all\nswept from her face.",
        "\u201cI shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my\nmind now.",
        "I shall write to Mr.",
        "Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair\nto-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.\u201d With a few grateful\nwords to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her\nway.",
        "\u201cAt least,\u201d said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the\nstairs, \u201cshe seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take\ncare of herself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she would need to be,\u201d said Holmes gravely.",
        "\u201cI am much mistaken if\nwe do not hear from her before many days are past.\u201d\n\nIt was not very long before my friend\u2019s prediction was fulfilled.",
        "A\nfortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning\nin her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human\nexperience this lonely woman had strayed into.",
        "The unusual salary, the\ncurious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something\nabnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a\nphilanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to\ndetermine.",
        "As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an\nhour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the\nmatter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it.",
        "\u201cData!",
        "data!",
        "data!\u201d he cried impatiently.",
        "\u201cI can\u2019t make bricks without clay.\u201d And\nyet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should\never have accepted such a situation.",
        "The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I\nwas thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those\nall-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I\nwould leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and\nfind him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the\nmorning.",
        "He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the\nmessage, threw it across to me.",
        "\u201cJust look up the trains in Bradshaw,\u201d said he, and turned back to his\nchemical studies.",
        "The summons was a brief and urgent one.",
        "\u201cPlease be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow,\u201d\nit said.",
        "\u201cDo come!",
        "I am at my wit\u2019s end.",
        "\u201cHUNTER.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWill you come with me?\u201d asked Holmes, glancing up.",
        "\u201cI should wish to.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust look it up, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a train at half-past nine,\u201d said I, glancing over my\nBradshaw.",
        "\u201cIt is due at Winchester at 11:30.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will do very nicely.",
        "Then perhaps I had better postpone my\nanalysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the\nmorning.\u201d\n\nBy eleven o\u2019clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old\nEnglish capital.",
        "Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the\nway down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them\ndown and began to admire the scenery.",
        "It was an ideal spring day, a\nlight blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across\nfrom west to east.",
        "The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was\nan exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man\u2019s energy.",
        "All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot,\nthe little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from\namid the light green of the new foliage.",
        "\u201cAre they not fresh and beautiful?\u201d I cried with all the enthusiasm of\na man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.",
        "But Holmes shook his head gravely.",
        "\u201cDo you know, Watson,\u201d said he, \u201cthat it is one of the curses of a mind\nwith a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to\nmy own special subject.",
        "You look at these scattered houses, and you are\nimpressed by their beauty.",
        "I look at them, and the only thought which\ncomes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with\nwhich crime may be committed there.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood heavens!\u201d I cried.",
        "\u201cWho would associate crime with these dear old\nhomesteads?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey always fill me with a certain horror.",
        "It is my belief, Watson,\nfounded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London\ndo not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and\nbeautiful countryside.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou horrify me!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the reason is very obvious.",
        "The pressure of public opinion can do\nin the town what the law cannot accomplish.",
        "There is no lane so vile\nthat the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard\u2019s blow,\ndoes not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then\nthe whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of\ncomplaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime\nand the dock.",
        "But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields,\nfilled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the\nlaw.",
        "Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which\nmay go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.",
        "Had\nthis lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I\nshould never have had a fear for her.",
        "It is the five miles of country\nwhich makes the danger.",
        "Still, it is clear that she is not personally\nthreatened.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.",
        "If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so.",
        "She has her freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat _can_ be the matter, then?",
        "Can you suggest no explanation?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover\nthe facts as far as we know them.",
        "But which of these is correct can\nonly be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt\nfind waiting for us.",
        "Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we\nshall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.\u201d\n\nThe Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no distance\nfrom the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us.",
        "She\nhad engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.",
        "\u201cI am so delighted that you have come,\u201d she said earnestly.",
        "\u201cIt is so\nvery kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do.",
        "Your\nadvice will be altogether invaluable to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPray tell us what has happened to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr.",
        "Rucastle to\nbe back before three.",
        "I got his leave to come into town this morning,\nthough he little knew for what purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us have everything in its due order.\u201d Holmes thrust his long thin\nlegs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.",
        "\u201cIn the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no\nactual ill-treatment from Mr.",
        "and Mrs.",
        "Rucastle.",
        "It is only fair to\nthem to say that.",
        "But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my\nmind about them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat can you not understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir reasons for their conduct.",
        "But you shall have it all just as it\noccurred.",
        "When I came down, Mr.",
        "Rucastle met me here and drove me in\nhis dog-cart to the Copper Beeches.",
        "It is, as he said, beautifully\nsituated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square\nblock of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp\nand bad weather.",
        "There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and\non the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton high road,\nwhich curves past about a hundred yards from the front door.",
        "This\nground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part\nof Lord Southerton\u2019s preserves.",
        "A clump of copper beeches immediately\nin front of the hall door has given its name to the place.",
        "\u201cI was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was\nintroduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.",
        "There was no\ntruth, Mr.",
        "Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable\nin your rooms at Baker Street.",
        "Mrs.",
        "Rucastle is not mad.",
        "I found her to\nbe a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more\nthan thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than\nforty-five.",
        "From their conversation I have gathered that they have been\nmarried about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only\nchild by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia.",
        "Mr.",
        "Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them\nwas that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother.",
        "As the\ndaughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that\nher position must have been uncomfortable with her father\u2019s young wife.",
        "\u201cMrs.",
        "Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in\nfeature.",
        "She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse.",
        "She was a\nnonentity.",
        "It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to\nher husband and to her little son.",
        "Her light grey eyes wandered\ncontinually from one to the other, noting every little want and\nforestalling it if possible.",
        "He was kind to her also in his bluff,\nboisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.",
        "And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman.",
        "She would often be lost\nin deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face.",
        "More than once I\nhave surprised her in tears.",
        "I have thought sometimes that it was the\ndisposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never\nmet so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature.",
        "He is\nsmall for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.",
        "His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage\nfits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking.",
        "Giving pain to any\ncreature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and\nhe shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice,\nlittle birds, and insects.",
        "But I would rather not talk about the\ncreature, Mr.",
        "Holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad of all details,\u201d remarked my friend, \u201cwhether they seem to\nyou to be relevant or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall try not to miss anything of importance.",
        "The one unpleasant\nthing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and\nconduct of the servants.",
        "There are only two, a man and his wife.",
        "Toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled\nhair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink.",
        "Twice since I have\nbeen with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr.",
        "Rucastle seemed to\ntake no notice of it.",
        "His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a\nsour face, as silent as Mrs.",
        "Rucastle and much less amiable.",
        "They are a\nmost unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the\nnursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of\nthe building.",
        "\u201cFor two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very\nquiet; on the third, Mrs.",
        "Rucastle came down just after breakfast and\nwhispered something to her husband.",
        "\u201c\u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said he, turning to me, \u2018we are very much obliged to you,\nMiss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.",
        "I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your\nappearance.",
        "We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become\nyou.",
        "You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you\nwould be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of\nblue.",
        "It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore\nunmistakable signs of having been worn before.",
        "It could not have been a\nbetter fit if I had been measured for it.",
        "Both Mr.",
        "and Mrs.",
        "Rucastle\nexpressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated\nin its vehemence.",
        "They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which\nis a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house,\nwith three long windows reaching down to the floor.",
        "A chair had been\nplaced close to the central window, with its back turned towards it.",
        "In\nthis I was asked to sit, and then Mr.",
        "Rucastle, walking up and down on\nthe other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest\nstories that I have ever listened to.",
        "You cannot imagine how comical he\nwas, and I laughed until I was quite weary.",
        "Mrs.",
        "Rucastle, however, who\nhas evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with\nher hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face.",
        "After an\nhour or so, Mr.",
        "Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence\nthe duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to\nlittle Edward in the nursery.",
        "\u201cTwo days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\nsimilar circumstances.",
        "Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the\nwindow, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which\nmy employer had an immense _r\u00e9pertoire_, and which he told inimitably.",
        "Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little\nsideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me\nto read aloud to him.",
        "I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the\nheart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he\nordered me to cease and to change my dress.",
        "\u201cYou can easily imagine, Mr.",
        "Holmes, how curious I became as to what\nthe meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be.",
        "They\nwere always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the\nwindow, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going\non behind my back.",
        "At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon\ndevised a means.",
        "My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought\nseized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief.",
        "On\nthe next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief\nup to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that\nthere was behind me.",
        "I confess that I was disappointed.",
        "There was\nnothing.",
        "At least that was my first impression.",
        "At the second glance,\nhowever, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton\nRoad, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in\nmy direction.",
        "The road is an important highway, and there are usually\npeople there.",
        "This man, however, was leaning against the railings which\nbordered our field and was looking earnestly up.",
        "I lowered my\nhandkerchief and glanced at Mrs.",
        "Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon\nme with a most searching gaze.",
        "She said nothing, but I am convinced\nthat she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had seen what\nwas behind me.",
        "She rose at once.",
        "\u201c\u2018Jephro,\u2019 said she, \u2018there is an impertinent fellow upon the road\nthere who stares up at Miss Hunter.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?\u2019 he asked.",
        "\u201c\u2018No, I know no one in these parts.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Dear me!",
        "How very impertinent!",
        "Kindly turn round and motion to him to\ngo away.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Surely it would be better to take no notice.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No, no, we should have him loitering here always.",
        "Kindly turn round\nand wave him away like that.\u2019\n\n\u201cI did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs.",
        "Rucastle drew down\nthe blind.",
        "That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again\nin the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the\nroad.\u201d\n\n\u201cPray continue,\u201d said Holmes.",
        "\u201cYour narrative promises to be a most\ninteresting one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to\nbe little relation between the different incidents of which I speak.",
        "On\nthe very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr.",
        "Rucastle took\nme to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door.",
        "As we\napproached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as\nof a large animal moving about.",
        "\u201c\u2018Look in here!\u2019 said Mr.",
        "Rucastle, showing me a slit between two\nplanks.",
        "\u2018Is he not a beauty?\u2019\n\n\u201cI looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague\nfigure huddled up in the darkness.",
        "\u201c\u2018Don\u2019t be frightened,\u2019 said my employer, laughing at the start which I\nhad given.",
        "\u2018It\u2019s only Carlo, my mastiff.",
        "I call him mine, but really\nold Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him.",
        "We\nfeed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as\nkeen as mustard.",
        "Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the\ntrespasser whom he lays his fangs upon.",
        "For goodness\u2019 sake don\u2019t you\never on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it\u2019s\nas much as your life is worth.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look\nout of my bedroom window about two o\u2019clock in the morning.",
        "It was a\nbeautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was\nsilvered over and almost as bright as day.",
        "I was standing, rapt in the\npeaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was\nmoving under the shadow of the copper beeches.",
        "As it emerged into the\nmoonshine I saw what it was.",
        "It was a giant dog, as large as a calf,\ntawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting\nbones.",
        "It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow\nupon the other side.",
        "That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart\nwhich I do not think that any burglar could have done.",
        "\u201cAnd now I have a very strange experience to tell you.",
        "I had, as you\nknow, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at\nthe bottom of my trunk.",
        "One evening, after the child was in bed, I\nbegan to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by\nrearranging my own little things.",
        "There was an old chest of drawers in\nthe room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked.",
        "I\nhad filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack\naway I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.",
        "It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I\ntook out my bunch of keys and tried to open it.",
        "The very first key\nfitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open.",
        "There was only one\nthing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was.",
        "It\nwas my coil of hair.",
        "\u201cI took it up and examined it.",
        "It was of the same peculiar tint, and\nthe same thickness.",
        "But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded\nitself upon me.",
        "How could my hair have been locked in the drawer?",
        "With\ntrembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew\nfrom the bottom my own hair.",
        "I laid the two tresses together, and I\nassure you that they were identical.",
        "Was it not extraordinary?",
        "Puzzle\nas I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant.",
        "I returned\nthe strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the\nRucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a\ndrawer which they had locked.",
        "\u201cI am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr.",
        "Holmes, and I\nsoon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.",
        "There was\none wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all.",
        "A door\nwhich faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into\nthis suite, but it was invariably locked.",
        "One day, however, as I\nascended the stair, I met Mr.",
        "Rucastle coming out through this door,\nhis keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very\ndifferent person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed.",
        "His\ncheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins\nstood out at his temples with passion.",
        "He locked the door and hurried\npast me without a word or a look.",
        "\u201cThis aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the\ngrounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could\nsee the windows of this part of the house.",

        "\u2018By the way,\u2019 said I, \u2018you seem\nto have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the\nshutters up.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my\nremark.",
        "\u201c\u2018Photography is one of my hobbies,\u2019 said he.",
        "\u2018I have made my dark room\nup there.",

        "Who would have ever believed it?\u2019 He spoke\nin a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at\nme.",
        "I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.",
        "\u201cWell, Mr.",
        "Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\nsomething about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all\non fire to go over them.",
        "It was not mere curiosity, though I have my\nshare of that.",
        "It was more a feeling of duty\u2014a feeling that some good\nmight come from my penetrating to this place.",
        "They talk of woman\u2019s\ninstinct; perhaps it was woman\u2019s instinct which gave me that feeling.",
        "At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any\nchance to pass the forbidden door.",
        "\u201cIt was only yesterday that the chance came.",
        "I may tell you that,\nbesides Mr.",
        "Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in\nthese deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen\nbag with him through the door.",
        "Recently he has been drinking hard, and\nyesterday evening he was very drunk; and when I came upstairs there was\nthe key in the door.",
        "I have no doubt at all that he had left it there.",
        "Mr.",
        "and Mrs.",
        "Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with\nthem, so that I had an admirable opportunity.",
        "I turned the key gently\nin the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.",
        "\u201cThere was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,\nwhich turned at a right angle at the farther end.",
        "Round this corner\nwere three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.",
        "They each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows\nin the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening\nlight glimmered dimly through them.",
        "The centre door was closed, and\nacross the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an\niron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at\nthe other with stout cord.",
        "The door itself was locked as well, and the\nkey was not there.",
        "This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the\nshuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from\nbeneath it that the room was not in darkness.",
        "Evidently there was a\nskylight which let in light from above.",
        "As I stood in the passage\ngazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, I\nsuddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass\nbackward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone\nout from under the door.",
        "A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the\nsight, Mr.",
        "Holmes.",
        "My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I\nturned and ran\u2014ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me\nclutching at the skirt of my dress.",
        "I rushed down the passage, through\nthe door, and straight into the arms of Mr.",
        "Rucastle, who was waiting\noutside.",
        "\u201c\u2018So,\u2019 said he, smiling, \u2018it was you, then.",
        "I thought that it must be\nwhen I saw the door open.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh, I am so frightened!\u2019 I panted.",
        "\u201c\u2018My dear young lady!",
        "my dear young lady!\u2019\u2014you cannot think how\ncaressing and soothing his manner was\u2014\u2018and what has frightened you, my\ndear young lady?\u2019\n\n\u201cBut his voice was just a little too coaxing.",
        "He overdid it.",
        "I was\nkeenly on my guard against him.",
        "\u201c\u2018I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,\u2019 I answered.",
        "\u2018But it\nis so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran\nout again.",
        "Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Only that?\u2019 said he, looking at me keenly.",
        "\u201c\u2018Why, what did you think?\u2019 I asked.",
        "\u201c\u2018Why do you think that I lock this door?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I am sure that I do not know.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018It is to keep people out who have no business there.",
        "Do you see?\u2019 He\nwas still smiling in the most amiable manner.",
        "\u201c\u2018I am sure if I had known\u2014\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Well, then, you know now.",
        "And if you ever put your foot over that\nthreshold again\u2019\u2014here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of\nrage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon\u2014\u2018I\u2019ll throw you\nto the mastiff.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was so terrified that I do not know what I did.",
        "I suppose that I\nmust have rushed past him into my room.",
        "I remember nothing until I\nfound myself lying on my bed trembling all over.",
        "Then I thought of you,\nMr.",
        "Holmes.",
        "I could not live there longer without some advice.",
        "I was\nfrightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,\neven of the child.",
        "They were all horrible to me.",
        "If I could only bring\nyou down all would be well.",
        "Of course I might have fled from the house,\nbut my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears.",
        "My mind was soon\nmade up.",
        "I would send you a wire.",
        "I put on my hat and cloak, went down\nto the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then\nreturned, feeling very much easier.",
        "A horrible doubt came into my mind\nas I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered\nthat Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that\nevening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had\nany influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him\nfree.",
        "I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at\nthe thought of seeing you.",
        "I had no difficulty in getting leave to come\ninto Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o\u2019clock,\nfor Mr.",
        "and Mrs.",
        "Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all\nthe evening, so that I must look after the child.",
        "Now I have told you\nall my adventures, Mr.",
        "Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could\ntell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.\u201d\n\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story.",
        "My\nfriend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his\npockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.",
        "\u201cIs Toller still drunk?\u201d he asked.",
        "\u201cYes.",
        "I heard his wife tell Mrs.",
        "Rucastle that she could do nothing\nwith him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is well.",
        "And the Rucastles go out to-night?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there a cellar with a good strong lock?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, the wine-cellar.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave\nand sensible girl, Miss Hunter.",
        "Do you think that you could perform one\nmore feat?",
        "I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite\nexceptional woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will try.",
        "What is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o\u2019clock, my friend and I.\nThe Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be\nincapable.",
        "There only remains Mrs.",
        "Toller, who might give the alarm.",
        "If\nyou could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the\nkey upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent!",
        "We shall then look thoroughly into the affair.",
        "Of course\nthere is only one feasible explanation.",
        "You have been brought there to\npersonate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.",
        "That is obvious.",
        "As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is\nthe daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to\nhave gone to America.",
        "You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in\nheight, figure, and the colour of your hair.",
        "Hers had been cut off,\nvery possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of\ncourse, yours had to be sacrificed also.",
        "By a curious chance you came\nupon her tresses.",
        "The man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of\nhers\u2014possibly her _fianc\u00e9_\u2014and no doubt, as you wore the girl\u2019s dress\nand were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he\nsaw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was\nperfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions.",
        "The dog\nis let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate\nwith her.",
        "So much is fairly clear.",
        "The most serious point in the case\nis the disposition of the child.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat on earth has that to do with it?\u201d I ejaculated.",
        "\u201cMy dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as\nto the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents.",
        "Don\u2019t you see\nthat the converse is equally valid.",
        "I have frequently gained my first\nreal insight into the character of parents by studying their children.",
        "This child\u2019s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty\u2019s\nsake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should\nsuspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in\ntheir power.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sure that you are right, Mr.",
        "Holmes,\u201d cried our client.",
        "\u201cA\nthousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit\nit.",
        "Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor\ncreature.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man.",
        "We\ncan do nothing until seven o\u2019clock.",
        "At that hour we shall be with you,\nand it will not be long before we solve the mystery.\u201d\n\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the\nCopper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house.",
        "The\ngroup of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in\nthe light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even\nhad Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.",
        "\u201cHave you managed it?\u201d asked Holmes.",
        "A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs.",
        "\u201cThat is Mrs.",
        "Toller in the cellar,\u201d said she.",
        "\u201cHer husband lies snoring on the\nkitchen rug.",
        "Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.",
        "Rucastle\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have done well indeed!\u201d cried Holmes with enthusiasm.",
        "\u201cNow lead\nthe way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.\u201d\n\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage,\nand found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had\ndescribed.",
        "Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar.",
        "Then he\ntried the various keys in the lock, but without success.",
        "No sound came\nfrom within, and at the silence Holmes\u2019 face clouded over.",
        "\u201cI trust that we are not too late,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cI think, Miss Hunter,\nthat we had better go in without you.",
        "Now, Watson, put your shoulder to\nit, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.\u201d\n\nIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.",
        "Together we rushed into the room.",
        "It was empty.",
        "There was no furniture\nsave a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen.",
        "The\nskylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.",
        "\u201cThere has been some villainy here,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cthis beauty has\nguessed Miss Hunter\u2019s intentions and has carried his victim off.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough the skylight.",
        "We shall soon see how he managed it.\u201d He swung\nhimself up onto the roof.",
        "\u201cAh, yes,\u201d he cried, \u201chere\u2019s the end of a\nlong light ladder against the eaves.",
        "That is how he did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it is impossible,\u201d said Miss Hunter; \u201cthe ladder was not there\nwhen the Rucastles went away.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has come back and done it.",
        "I tell you that he is a clever and\ndangerous man.",
        "I should not be very much surprised if this were he\nwhose step I hear now upon the stair.",
        "I think, Watson, that it would be\nas well for you to have your pistol ready.\u201d\n\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the\ndoor of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his\nhand.",
        "Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of\nhim, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.",
        "\u201cYou villain!\u201d said he, \u201cwhere\u2019s your daughter?\u201d\n\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.",
        "\u201cIt is for me to ask you that,\u201d he shrieked, \u201cyou thieves!",
        "Spies and\nthieves!",
        "I have caught you, have I?",
        "You are in my power.",
        "I\u2019ll serve\nyou!\u201d He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s gone for the dog!\u201d cried Miss Hunter.",
        "\u201cI have my revolver,\u201d said I.",
        "\u201cBetter close the front door,\u201d cried Holmes, and we all rushed down the\nstairs together.",
        "We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the\nbaying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying\nsound which it was dreadful to listen to.",
        "An elderly man with a red\nface and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.",
        "\u201cMy God!\u201d he cried.",
        "\u201cSomeone has loosed the dog.",
        "It\u2019s not been fed for\ntwo days.",
        "Quick, quick, or it\u2019ll be too late!\u201d\n\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller\nhurrying behind us.",
        "There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle\nburied in Rucastle\u2019s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the\nground.",
        "Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its\nkeen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck.",
        "With\nmuch labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly\nmangled, into the house.",
        "We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and\nhaving dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I\ndid what I could to relieve his pain.",
        "We were all assembled round him\nwhen the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.",
        "\u201cMrs.",
        "Toller!\u201d cried Miss Hunter.",
        "\u201cYes, miss.",
        "Mr.",
        "Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up\nto you.",
        "Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn\u2019t let me know what you were\nplanning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa!\u201d said Holmes, looking keenly at her.",
        "\u201cIt is clear that Mrs.",
        "Toller\nknows more about this matter than anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points\non which I must confess that I am still in the dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will soon make it clear to you,\u201d said she; \u201cand I\u2019d have done so\nbefore now if I could ha\u2019 got out from the cellar.",
        "If there\u2019s\npolice-court business over this, you\u2019ll remember that I was the one\nthat stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice\u2019s friend too.",
        "\u201cShe was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn\u2019t, from the time that her\nfather married again.",
        "She was slighted like and had no say in anything,\nbut it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr.",
        "Fowler\nat a friend\u2019s house.",
        "As well as I could learn, Miss Alice had rights of\nher own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she\nnever said a word about them but just left everything in Mr.",
        "Rucastle\u2019s\nhands.",
        "He knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a\nhusband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give\nhim, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it.",
        "He wanted her\nto sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her\nmoney.",
        "When she wouldn\u2019t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got\nbrain-fever, and for six weeks was at death\u2019s door.",
        "Then she got better\nat last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but\nthat didn\u2019t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as\ntrue as man could be.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI think that what you have been good enough to tell\nus makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all that\nremains.",
        "Mr.",
        "Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of\nimprisonment?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the\ndisagreeable persistence of Mr.",
        "Fowler.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was it, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Mr.",
        "Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,\nblockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,\nmetallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the\nsame as his.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr.",
        "Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Toller serenely.",
        "\u201cAnd in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of\ndrink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master\nhad gone out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have it, sir, just as it happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs.",
        "Toller,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cfor you\nhave certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us.",
        "And here comes\nthe country surgeon and Mrs.",
        "Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had\nbest escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our\n_locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.\u201d\n\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper\nbeeches in front of the door.",
        "Mr.",
        "Rucastle survived, but was always a\nbroken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.",
        "They still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of\nRucastle\u2019s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them.",
        "Mr.",
        "Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in\nSouthampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a\ngovernment appointment in the island of Mauritius.",
        "As to Miss Violet\nHunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no\nfurther interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of\none of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at\nWalsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.",

        "PREFACE.",
        "The event on which this fiction is founded has been supposed, by Dr.",
        "Darwin, and some of the physiological writers of Germany, as not of\nimpossible occurrence.",
        "I shall not be supposed as according the remotest\ndegree of serious faith to such an imagination; yet, in assuming it as\nthe basis of a work of fancy, I have not considered myself as merely\nweaving a series of supernatural terrors.",
        "The event on which the\ninterest of the story depends is exempt from the disadvantages of a mere\ntale of spectres or enchantment.",
        "It was recommended by the novelty of\nthe situations which it developes; and, however impossible as a physical\nfact, affords a point of view to the imagination for the delineating of\nhuman passions more comprehensive and commanding than any which the\nordinary relations of existing events can yield.",
        "I have thus endeavoured to preserve the truth of the elementary\nprinciples of human nature, while I have not scrupled to innovate\nupon their combinations.",
        "The _Iliad_, the tragic poetry of\nGreece,\u2014Shakespeare, in the _Tempest_ and _Midsummer Night\u2019s\nDream_,\u2014and most especially Milton, in _Paradise Lost_, conform to this\nrule; and the most humble novelist, who seeks to confer or receive\namusement from his labours, may, without presumption, apply to prose\nfiction a licence, or rather a rule, from the adoption of which so many\nexquisite combinations of human feeling have resulted in the highest\nspecimens of poetry.",
        "The circumstance on which my story rests was suggested in casual\nconversation.",
        "It was commenced, partly as a source of amusement, and\npartly as an expedient for exercising any untried resources of mind.",
        "Other motives were mingled with these, as the work proceeded.",
        "I am by no\nmeans indifferent to the manner in which whatever moral tendencies exist\nin the sentiments or characters it contains shall affect the reader; yet\nmy chief concern in this respect has been limited to the avoiding of the\nenervating effects of the novels of the present day, and to the\nexhibitions of the amiableness of domestic affection, and the excellence\nof universal virtue.",
        "The opinions which naturally spring from the\ncharacter and situation of the hero are by no means to be conceived as\nexisting always in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be\ndrawn from the following pages as prejudicing any philosophical doctrine\nof whatever kind.",
        "It is a subject also of additional interest to the author, that this\nstory was begun in the majestic region where the scene is principally\nlaid, and in society which cannot cease to be regretted.",
        "I passed the\nsummer of 1816 in the environs of Geneva.",
        "The season was cold and rainy,\nand in the evenings we crowded around a blazing wood fire, and\noccasionally amused ourselves with some German stories of ghosts, which\nhappened to fall into our hands.",
        "These tales excited in us a playful\ndesire of imitation.",
        "Two other friends (a tale from the pen of one of\nwhom would be far more acceptable to the public than any thing I can\never hope to produce) and myself agreed to write each a story, founded\non some supernatural occurrence.",
        "The weather, however, suddenly became serene; and my two friends left me\non a journey among the Alps, and lost, in the magnificent scenes which\nthey present, all memory of their ghostly visions.",

        "Do you understand this\nfeeling?",
        "This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which\nI am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.",

        "I may there discover\nthe wondrous power which attracts the needle; and may regulate a\nthousand celestial observations, that require only this voyage to render\ntheir seeming eccentricities consistent for ever.",
        "I shall satiate my\nardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before\nvisited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man.",
        "These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of\ndanger or death, and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with\nthe joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday\nmates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river.",
        "But, supposing\nall these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable\nbenefit which I shall confer on all mankind to the last generation, by\ndiscovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which\nat present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret\nof the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an\nundertaking such as mine.",
        "These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\nletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to\nheaven; for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a\nsteady purpose,\u2014a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye.",
        "This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.",
        "I have\nread with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been\nmade in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the\nseas which surround the pole.",
        "You may remember, that a history of all\nthe voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our\ngood uncle Thomas\u2019s library.",
        "My education was neglected, yet I was\npassionately fond of reading.",
        "These volumes were my study day and night,\nand my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as\na child, on learning that my father\u2019s dying injunction had forbidden my\nuncle to allow me to embark in a sea-faring life.",
        "These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\nwhose effusions entranced my soul, and lifted it to heaven.",
        "I also\nbecame a poet, and for one year lived in a Paradise of my own creation;\nI imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\nnames of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.",
        "You are well acquainted\nwith my failure, and how heavily I bore the disappointment.",
        "But just at\nthat time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my thoughts were\nturned into the channel of their earlier bent.",
        "Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.",
        "I can,\neven now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great\nenterprise.",
        "I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.",
        "I accompanied\nthe whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily\nendured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder\nthan the common sailors during the day, and devoted my nights to the\nstudy of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of\nphysical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest\npractical advantage.",
        "Twice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in\na Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration.",
        "I must own I\nfelt a little proud, when my captain offered me the second dignity in\nthe vessel, and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness; so\nvaluable did he consider my services.",
        "And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great\npurpose.",
        "My life might have been passed in ease and luxury; but I\npreferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path.",
        "Oh,\nthat some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative!",
        "My courage\nand my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are\noften depressed.",
        "I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage;\nthe emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not\nonly to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own,\nwhen their\u2019s are failing.",
        "This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.",
        "They fly\nquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\nmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stage-coach.",
        "The\ncold is not excessive, if you are wrapt in furs, a dress which I have\nalready adopted; for there is a great difference between walking the\ndeck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\nprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.",
        "I have no\nambition to lose my life on the post-road between St.",
        "Petersburgh and\nArchangel.",
        "I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying\nthe insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think\nnecessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing.",
        "I do not\nintend to sail until the month of June: and when shall I return?",
        "Ah,\ndear sister, how can I answer this question?",
        "If I succeed, many, many\nmonths, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet.",
        "If I fail,\nyou will see me again soon, or never.",
        "Farewell, my dear, excellent, Margaret.",
        "Heaven shower down blessings on\nyou, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for\nall your love and kindness.",

        "LETTER II.",
        "_To Mrs._ SAVILLE, _England_.",
        "Archangel, 28th March, 17\u2014.",
        "How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow;\nyet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.",
        "I have hired a vessel,\nand am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already\nengaged appear to be men on whom I can depend, and are certainly\npossessed of dauntless courage.",
        "But I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy; and the\nabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil.",
        "I have\nno friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success,\nthere will be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by\ndisappointment, no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection.",
        "I\nshall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium\nfor the communication of feeling.",
        "I desire the company of a man who\ncould sympathize with me; whose eyes would reply to mine.",
        "You may deem\nme romantic, my dear sister, but I bitterly feel the want of a friend.",
        "I\nhave no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as\nwell as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve\nor amend my plans.",
        "How would such a friend repair the faults of your\npoor brother!",
        "I am too ardent in execution, and too impatient of\ndifficulties.",
        "But it is a still greater evil to me that I am\nself-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a\ncommon, and read nothing but our uncle Thomas\u2019s books of voyages.",
        "At\nthat age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\ncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive\nits most important benefits from such a conviction, that I perceived the\nnecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my\nnative country.",
        "Now I am twenty-eight, and am in reality more illiterate\nthan many school-boys of fifteen.",
        "It is true that I have thought more,\nand that my day dreams are more extended and magnificent; but they want\n(as the painters call it) _keeping_; and I greatly need a friend who\nwould have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection\nenough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind.",
        "Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on\nthe wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen.",
        "Yet some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in\nthese rugged bosoms.",
        "My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful\ncourage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory.",
        "He is an\nEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\nunsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\nhumanity.",
        "I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel:\nfinding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to\nassist in my enterprise.",
        "The master is a person of an excellent disposition, and is remarkable in\nthe ship for his gentleness, and the mildness of his discipline.",
        "He is,\nindeed, of so amiable a nature, that he will not hunt (a favourite, and\nalmost the only amusement here), because he cannot endure to spill\nblood.",
        "He is, moreover, heroically generous.",
        "Some years ago he loved a\nyoung Russian lady, of moderate fortune; and having amassed a\nconsiderable sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the\nmatch.",
        "He saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she\nwas bathed in tears, and, throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to\nspare her, confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that\nhe was poor, and that her father would never consent to the union.",
        "My\ngenerous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the\nname of her lover instantly abandoned his pursuit.",
        "He had already bought\na farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of\nhis life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the\nremains of his prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited\nthe young woman\u2019s father to consent to her marriage with her lover.",
        "But\nthe old man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my\nfriend; who, when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country,\nnor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married\naccording to her inclinations.",
        "\u201cWhat a noble fellow!\u201d you will exclaim.",
        "He is so; but then he has passed all his life on board a vessel, and has\nscarcely an idea beyond the rope and the shroud.",
        "But do not suppose that, because I complain a little, or because I can\nconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\nwavering in my resolutions.",
        "Those are as fixed as fate; and my voyage is\nonly now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.",
        "The\nwinter has been dreadfully severe; but the spring promises well, and it\nis considered as a remarkably early season; so that, perhaps, I may sail\nsooner than I expected.",
        "I shall do nothing rashly; you know me\nsufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\nsafety of others is committed to my care.",
        "I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\nundertaking.",
        "It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the\ntrembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am\npreparing to depart.",
        "I am going to unexplored regions, to \u201cthe land of\nmist and snow;\u201d but I shall kill no albatross, therefore do not be\nalarmed for my safety.",
        "Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and\nreturned by the most southern cape of Africa or America?",
        "I dare not\nexpect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on the reverse of the\npicture.",
        "Continue to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive\nyour letters (though the chance is very doubtful) on some occasions when\nI need them most to support my spirits.",
        "I love you very tenderly.",

        "MY DEAR SISTER,\n\nI write a few lines in haste, to say that I am safe, and well advanced\non my voyage.",
        "This letter will reach England by a merchant-man now on\nits homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not\nsee my native land, perhaps, for many years.",
        "I am, however, in good\nspirits: my men are bold, and apparently firm of purpose; nor do the\nfloating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers\nof the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them.",
        "We\nhave already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of\nsummer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,\nwhich blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire\nto attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not\nexpected.",
        "No incidents have hitherto befallen us, that would make a figure in a\nletter.",
        "One or two stiff gales, and the breaking of a mast, are\naccidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record; and\nI shall be well content, if nothing worse happen to us during our\nvoyage.",
        "Adieu, my dear Margaret.",
        "Be assured, that for my own sake, as well as\nyour\u2019s, I will not rashly encounter danger.",

        "Remember me to all my English friends.",
        "Most affectionately yours,\n\nR. W.\n\n\n\n\nLETTER IV.",
        "_To Mrs._ SAVILLE, _England_.",
        "August 5th, 17\u2014.",
        "So strange an accident has happened to us, that I cannot forbear\nrecording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before\nthese papers can come into your possession.",
        "Last Monday (July 31st), we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed\nin the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea room in which she\nfloated.",
        "Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were\ncompassed round by a very thick fog.",
        "We accordingly lay to, hoping that\nsome change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.",
        "About two o\u2019clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in\nevery direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have\nno end.",
        "Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow\nwatchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted\nour attention, and diverted our solicitude from our own situation.",
        "We\nperceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on\ntowards the north, at the distance of half a mile: a being which had the\nshape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature, sat in the sledge,\nand guided the dogs.",
        "We watched the rapid progress of the traveller\nwith our telescopes, until he was lost among the distant inequalities of\nthe ice.",
        "This appearance excited our unqualified wonder.",
        "We were, as we believed,\nmany hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote\nthat it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed.",
        "Shut in,\nhowever, by ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had\nobserved with the greatest attention.",
        "About two hours after this occurrence, we heard the ground sea; and\nbefore night the ice broke, and freed our ship.",
        "We, however, lay to\nuntil the morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose\nmasses which float about after the breaking up of the ice.",
        "I profited of\nthis time to rest for a few hours.",
        "In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck, and\nfound all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently talking\nto some one in the sea.",
        "It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we had seen\nbefore, which had drifted towards us in the night, on a large fragment\nof ice.",
        "Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within\nit, whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.",
        "He was not, as\nthe other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some\nundiscovered island, but an European.",
        "When I appeared on deck, the\nmaster said, \u201cHere is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish\non the open sea.\u201d\n\nOn perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a\nforeign accent.",
        "\u201cBefore I come on board your vessel,\u201d said he, \u201cwill you\nhave the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?\u201d\n\nYou may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to\nme from a man on the brink of destruction, and to whom I should have\nsupposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not\nhave exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.",
        "I\nreplied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the\nnorthern pole.",
        "Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied, and consented to come on board.",
        "Good God!",
        "Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his\nsafety, your surprise would have been boundless.",
        "His limbs were nearly\nfrozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering.",
        "I\nnever saw a man in so wretched a condition.",
        "We attempted to carry him\ninto the cabin; but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air, he fainted.",
        "We accordingly brought him back to the deck, and restored him to\nanimation by rubbing him with brandy, and forcing him to swallow a small\nquantity.",
        "As soon as he shewed signs of life, we wrapped him up in\nblankets, and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen-stove.",
        "By slow\ndegrees he recovered, and ate a little soup, which restored him\nwonderfully.",
        "Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak; and I often\nfeared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.",
        "When he\nhad in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin, and\nattended on him as much as my duty would permit.",
        "I never saw a more\ninteresting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness,\nand even madness; but there are moments when, if any one performs an act\nof kindness towards him, or does him any the most trifling service, his\nwhole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence\nand sweetness that I never saw equalled.",
        "But he is generally melancholy\nand despairing; and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if impatient of\nthe weight of woes that oppresses him.",
        "When my guest was a little recovered, I had great trouble to keep off\nthe men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not\nallow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body\nand mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.",
        "Once,\nhowever, the lieutenant asked, Why he had come so far upon the ice in so\nstrange a vehicle?",
        "His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom; and he\nreplied, \u201cTo seek one who fled from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I fancy we have seen him; for, the day before we picked you up, we\nsaw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.\u201d\n\nThis aroused the stranger\u2019s attention; and he asked a multitude of\nquestions concerning the route which the d\u00e6mon, as he called him, had\npursued.",
        "Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, \u201cI have,\ndoubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people;\nbut you are too considerate to make inquiries.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to\ntrouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\nbenevolently restored me to life.\u201d\n\nSoon after this he inquired, if I thought that the breaking up of the\nice had destroyed the other sledge?",
        "I replied, that I could not answer\nwith any degree of certainty; for the ice had not broken until near\nmidnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety\nbefore that time; but of this I could not judge.",
        "From this time the stranger seemed very eager to be upon deck, to watch\nfor the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to\nremain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of\nthe atmosphere.",
        "But I have promised that some one should watch for him,\nand give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.",
        "Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the\npresent day.",
        "The stranger has gradually improved in health, but is very\nsilent, and appears uneasy when any one except myself enters his cabin.",
        "Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle, that the sailors are all\ninterested in him, although they have had very little communication with\nhim.",
        "For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother; and his constant\nand deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.",
        "He must have been\na noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck so\nattractive and amiable.",
        "I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no\nfriend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit\nhad been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as\nthe brother of my heart.",
        "I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should\nI have any fresh incidents to record.",
        "*       *       *       *       *\n\nAugust 13th, 17\u2014.",
        "My affection for my guest increases every day.",
        "He excites at once my\nadmiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.",
        "How can I see so noble\na creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief?",
        "He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated; and when he\nspeaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they\nflow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.",
        "He is now much recovered from his illness, and is continually on the\ndeck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own.",
        "Yet,\nalthough unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery, but\nthat he interests himself deeply in the employments of others.",
        "He has\nasked me many questions concerning my design; and I have related my\nlittle history frankly to him.",
        "He appeared pleased with the confidence,\nand suggested several alterations in my plan, which I shall find\nexceedingly useful.",
        "There is no pedantry in his manner; but all he does\nappears to spring solely from the interest he instinctively takes in the\nwelfare of those who surround him.",
        "He is often overcome by gloom, and\nthen he sits by himself, and tries to overcome all that is sullen or\nunsocial in his humour.",
        "These paroxysms pass from him like a cloud from\nbefore the sun, though his dejection never leaves him.",
        "I have\nendeavoured to win his confidence; and I trust that I have succeeded.",
        "One day I mentioned to him the desire I had always felt of finding a\nfriend who might sympathize with me, and direct me by his counsel.",
        "I\nsaid, I did not belong to that class of men who are offended by advice.",
        "\u201cI am self-educated, and perhaps I hardly rely sufficiently upon my own\npowers.",
        "I wish therefore that my companion should be wiser and more\nexperienced than myself, to confirm and support me; nor have I believed\nit impossible to find a true friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree with you,\u201d replied the stranger, \u201cin believing that friendship\nis not only a desirable, but a possible acquisition.",
        "I once had a\nfriend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore,\nto judge respecting friendship.",
        "You have hope, and the world before you,\nand have no cause for despair.",
        "But I\u2014\u2014I have lost every thing, and\ncannot begin life anew.\u201d\n\nAs he said this, his countenance became expressive of a calm settled\ngrief, that touched me to the heart.",
        "But he was silent, and presently\nretired to his cabin.",
        "Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does\nthe beauties of nature.",
        "The starry sky, the sea, and every sight\nafforded by these wonderful regions, seems still to have the power of\nelevating his soul from earth.",
        "Such a man has a double existence: he may\nsuffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; yet when he has\nretired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit, that has a\nhalo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.",
        "Will you laugh at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine\nwanderer?",
        "If you do, you must have certainly lost that simplicity which\nwas once your characteristic charm.",
        "Yet, if you will, smile at the\nwarmth of my expressions, while I find every day new causes for\nrepeating them.",
        "*       *       *       *       *\n\nAugust 19th, 17\u2014.",
        "Yesterday the stranger said to me, \u201cYou may easily perceive, Captain\nWalton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.",
        "I had\ndetermined, once, that the memory of these evils should die with me; but\nyou have won me to alter my determination.",
        "You seek for knowledge and\nwisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of\nyour wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been.",
        "I do\nnot know that the relation of my misfortunes will be useful to you, yet,\nif you are inclined, listen to my tale.",
        "I believe that the strange\nincidents connected with it will afford a view of nature, which may\nenlarge your faculties and understanding.",
        "You will hear of powers and\noccurrences, such as you have been accustomed to believe impossible: but\nI do not doubt that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of\nthe truth of the events of which it is composed.\u201d\n\nYou may easily conceive that I was much gratified by the offered\ncommunication; yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by\na recital of his misfortunes.",
        "I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the\npromised narrative, partly from curiosity, and partly from a strong\ndesire to ameliorate his fate, if it were in my power.",
        "I expressed these\nfeelings in my answer.",
        "\u201cI thank you,\u201d he replied, \u201cfor your sympathy, but it is useless; my\nfate is nearly fulfilled.",
        "I wait but for one event, and then I shall\nrepose in peace.",
        "I understand your feeling,\u201d continued he, perceiving\nthat I wished to interrupt him; \u201cbut you are mistaken, my friend, if\nthus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny: listen\nto my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined.\u201d\n\nHe then told me, that he would commence his narrative the next day when\nI should be at leisure.",
        "This promise drew from me the warmest thanks.",
        "I\nhave resolved every night, when I am not engaged, to record, as nearly\nas possible in his own words, what he has related during the day.",
        "If I\nshould be engaged, I will at least make notes.",
        "This manuscript will\ndoubtless afford you the greatest pleasure: but to me, who know him, and\nwho hear it from his own lips, with what interest and sympathy shall I\nread it in some future day!",
        "FRANKENSTEIN;\n\nOR,\n\nTHE MODERN PROMETHEUS.",
        "CHAPTER I.\n\n\nI am by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the most distinguished\nof that republic.",
        "My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and\nsyndics; and my father had filled several public situations with honour\nand reputation.",
        "He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity\nand indefatigable attention to public business.",
        "He passed his younger\ndays perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; and it was not\nuntil the decline of life that he thought of marrying, and bestowing on\nthe state sons who might carry his virtues and his name down to\nposterity.",
        "As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\nrefrain from relating them.",
        "One of his most intimate friends was a\nmerchant, who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\nmischances, into poverty.",
        "This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\nproud and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in poverty\nand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\ndistinguished for his rank and magnificence.",
        "Having paid his debts,\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his daughter\nto the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness.",
        "My\nfather loved Beaufort with the truest friendship, and was deeply grieved\nby his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.",
        "He grieved also for\nthe loss of his society, and resolved to seek him out and endeavour to\npersuade him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance.",
        "Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten\nmonths before my father discovered his abode.",
        "Overjoyed at this\ndiscovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean\nstreet, near the Reuss.",
        "But when he entered, misery and despair alone\nwelcomed him.",
        "Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the\nwreck of his fortunes; but it was sufficient to provide him with\nsustenance for some months, and in the mean time he hoped to procure\nsome respectable employment in a merchant\u2019s house.",
        "The interval was\nconsequently spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and\nrankling, when he had leisure for reflection; and at length it took so\nfast hold of his mind, that at the end of three months he lay on a bed\nof sickness, incapable of any exertion.",
        "His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness; but she saw with\ndespair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there\nwas no other prospect of support.",
        "But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind\nof an uncommon mould; and her courage rose to support her in her\nadversity.",
        "She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by various\nmeans contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.",
        "Several months passed in this manner.",
        "Her father grew worse; her time\nwas more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence\ndecreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving\nher an orphan and a beggar.",
        "This last blow overcame her; and she knelt\nby Beaufort\u2019s coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the\nchamber.",
        "He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who\ncommitted herself to his care, and after the interment of his friend he\nconducted her to Geneva, and placed her under the protection of a\nrelation.",
        "Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.",
        "When my father became a husband and a parent, he found his time so\noccupied by the duties of his new situation, that he relinquished many\nof his public employments, and devoted himself to the education of his\nchildren.",
        "Of these I was the eldest, and the destined successor to all\nhis labours and utility.",
        "No creature could have more tender parents than\nmine.",
        "My improvement and health were their constant care, especially as\nI remained for several years their only child.",
        "But before I continue my\nnarrative, I must record an incident which took place when I was four\nyears of age.",
        "My father had a sister, whom he tenderly loved, and who had married\nearly in life an Italian gentleman.",
        "Soon after her marriage, she had\naccompanied her husband into her native country, and for some years my\nfather had very little communication with her.",
        "About the time I\nmentioned she died; and a few months afterwards he received a letter\nfrom her husband, acquainting him with his intention of marrying an\nItalian lady, and requesting my father to take charge of the infant\nElizabeth, the only child of his deceased sister.",
        "\u201cIt is my wish,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cthat you should consider her as your own daughter, and educate\nher thus.",
        "Her mother\u2019s fortune is secured to her, the documents of which\nI will commit to your keeping.",
        "Reflect upon this proposition; and decide\nwhether you would prefer educating your niece yourself to her being\nbrought up by a stepmother.\u201d\n\nMy father did not hesitate, and immediately went to Italy, that he\nmight accompany the little Elizabeth to her future home.",
        "I have often\nheard my mother say, that she was at that time the most beautiful child\nshe had ever seen, and shewed signs even then of a gentle and\naffectionate disposition.",
        "These indications, and a desire to bind as\nclosely as possible the ties of domestic love, determined my mother to\nconsider Elizabeth as my future wife; a design which she never found\nreason to repent.",
        "From this time Elizabeth Lavenza became my playfellow, and, as we grew\nolder, my friend.",
        "She was docile and good tempered, yet gay and playful\nas a summer insect.",
        "Although she was lively and animated, her feelings\nwere strong and deep, and her disposition uncommonly affectionate.",
        "No\none could better enjoy liberty, yet no one could submit with more grace\nthan she did to constraint and caprice.",
        "Her imagination was luxuriant,\nyet her capability of application was great.",
        "Her person was the image of\nher mind; her hazel eyes, although as lively as a bird\u2019s, possessed an\nattractive softness.",
        "Her figure was light and airy; and, though capable\nof enduring great fatigue, she appeared the most fragile creature in the\nworld.",
        "While I admired her understanding and fancy, I loved to tend on\nher, as I should on a favourite animal; and I never saw so much grace\nboth of person and mind united to so little pretension.",
        "Every one adored Elizabeth.",
        "If the servants had any request to make, it\nwas always through her intercession.",
        "We were strangers to any species of\ndisunion and dispute; for although there was a great dissimilitude in\nour characters, there was an harmony in that very dissimilitude.",
        "I was\nmore calm and philosophical than my companion; yet my temper was not so\nyielding.",
        "My application was of longer endurance; but it was not so\nsevere whilst it endured.",
        "I delighted in investigating the facts\nrelative to the actual world; she busied herself in following the a\u00ebrial\ncreations of the poets.",
        "The world was to me a secret, which I desired to\ndiscover; to her it was a vacancy, which she sought to people with\nimaginations of her own.",
        "My brothers were considerably younger than myself; but I had a friend\nin one of my schoolfellows, who compensated for this deficiency.",
        "Henry\nClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva, an intimate friend of my\nfather.",
        "He was a boy of singular talent and fancy.",
        "I remember, when he\nwas nine years old, he wrote a fairy tale, which was the delight and\namazement of all his companions.",
        "His favourite study consisted in books\nof chivalry and romance; and when very young, I can remember, that we\nused to act plays composed by him out of these favourite books, the\nprincipal characters of which were Orlando, Robin Hood, Amadis, and St.",
        "George.",
        "No youth could have passed more happily than mine.",
        "My parents were\nindulgent, and my companions amiable.",
        "Our studies were never forced; and\nby some means we always had an end placed in view, which excited us to\nardour in the prosecution of them.",
        "It was by this method, and not by\nemulation, that we were urged to application.",
        "Elizabeth was not incited\nto apply herself to drawing, that her companions might not outstrip her;\nbut through the desire of pleasing her aunt, by the representation of\nsome favourite scene done by her own hand.",
        "We learned Latin and English,\nthat we might read the writings in those languages; and so far from\nstudy being made odious to us through punishment, we loved application,\nand our amusements would have been the labours of other children.",
        "Perhaps we did not read so many books, or learn languages so quickly, as\nthose who are disciplined according to the ordinary methods; but what\nwe learned was impressed the more deeply on our memories.",
        "In this description of our domestic circle I include Henry Clerval; for\nhe was constantly with us.",
        "He went to school with me, and generally\npassed the afternoon at our house; for being an only child, and\ndestitute of companions at home, his father was well pleased that he\nshould find associates at our house; and we were never completely happy\nwhen Clerval was absent.",
        "I feel pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before\nmisfortune had tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of\nextensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.",
        "But,\nin drawing the picture of my early days, I must not omit to record those\nevents which led, by insensible steps to my after tale of misery: for\nwhen I would account to myself for the birth of that passion, which\nafterwards ruled my destiny, I find it arise, like a mountain river,\nfrom ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it\nproceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course, has swept away\nall my hopes and joys.",
        "Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire\ntherefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my\npredilection for that science.",
        "When I was thirteen years of age, we all\nwent on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon: the inclemency of\nthe weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn.",
        "In this\nhouse I chanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa.",
        "I\nopened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate, and\nthe wonderful facts which he relates, soon changed this feeling into\nenthusiasm.",
        "A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind; and, bounding with\njoy, I communicated my discovery to my father.",
        "I cannot help remarking\nhere the many opportunities instructors possess of directing the\nattention of their pupils to useful knowledge, which they utterly\nneglect.",
        "My father looked carelessly at the title-page of my book, and\nsaid, \u201cAh!",
        "Cornelius Agrippa!",
        "My dear Victor, do not waste your time\nupon this; it is sad trash.\u201d\n\nIf, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains, to explain to\nme, that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded, and that\na modern system of science had been introduced, which possessed much\ngreater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were\nchimerical, while those of the former were real and practical; under\nsuch circumstances, I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside, and,\nwith my imagination warmed as it was, should probably have applied\nmyself to the more rational theory of chemistry which has resulted from\nmodern discoveries.",
        "It is even possible, that the train of my ideas\nwould never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.",
        "But the\ncursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me\nthat he was acquainted with its contents; and I continued to read with\nthe greatest avidity.",
        "When I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of\nthis author, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus.",
        "I read\nand studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they\nappeared to me treasures known to few beside myself; and although I\noften wished to communicate these secret stores of knowledge to my\nfather, yet his indefinite censure of my favourite Agrippa always\nwithheld me.",
        "I disclosed my discoveries to Elizabeth, therefore, under a\npromise of strict secrecy; but she did not interest herself in the\nsubject, and I was left by her to pursue my studies alone.",
        "It may appear very strange, that a disciple of Albertus Magnus should\narise in the eighteenth century; but our family was not scientifical,\nand I had not attended any of the lectures given at the schools of\nGeneva.",
        "My dreams were therefore undisturbed by reality; and I entered\nwith the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher\u2019s stone\nand the elixir of life.",
        "But the latter obtained my most undivided\nattention: wealth was an inferior object; but what glory would attend\nthe discovery, if I could banish disease from the human frame, and\nrender man invulnerable to any but a violent death!",
        "Nor were these my only visions.",
        "The raising of ghosts or devils was a\npromise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of\nwhich I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always\nunsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and\nmistake, than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors.",
        "The natural ph\u00e6nomena that take place every day before our eyes did not\nescape my examinations.",
        "Distillation, and the wonderful effects of\nsteam, processes of which my favourite authors were utterly ignorant,\nexcited my astonishment; but my utmost wonder was engaged by some\nexperiments on an air-pump, which I saw employed by a gentleman whom we\nwere in the habit of visiting.",
        "The ignorance of the early philosophers on these and several other\npoints served to decrease their credit with me: but I could not entirely\nthrow them aside, before some other system should occupy their place in\nmy mind.",
        "When I was about fifteen years old, we had retired to our house near\nBelrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunder-storm.",
        "It\nadvanced from behind the mountains of Jura; and the thunder burst at\nonce with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens.",
        "I\nremained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity\nand delight.",
        "As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of\nfire issue from an old and beautiful oak, which stood about twenty yards\nfrom our house; and so soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had\ndisappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump.",
        "When we visited\nit the next morning, we found the tree shattered in a singular manner.",
        "It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin\nribbands of wood.",
        "I never beheld any thing so utterly destroyed.",
        "The catastrophe of this tree excited my extreme astonishment; and I\neagerly inquired of my father the nature and origin of thunder and\nlightning.",
        "He replied, \u201cElectricity;\u201d describing at the same time the\nvarious effects of that power.",
        "He constructed a small electrical\nmachine, and exhibited a few experiments; he made also a kite, with a\nwire and string, which drew down that fluid from the clouds.",
        "This last stroke completed the overthrow of Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus\nMagnus, and Paracelsus, who had so long reigned the lords of my\nimagination.",
        "But by some fatality I did not feel inclined to commence\nthe study of any modern system; and this disinclination was influenced\nby the following circumstance.",
        "My father expressed a wish that I should attend a course of lectures\nupon natural philosophy, to which I cheerfully consented.",
        "Some accident\nprevented my attending these lectures until the course was nearly\nfinished.",
        "The lecture, being therefore one of the last, was entirely\nincomprehensible to me.",
        "The professor discoursed with the greatest\nfluency of potassium and boron, of sulphates and oxyds, terms to which I\ncould affix no idea; and I became disgusted with the science of natural\nphilosophy, although I still read Pliny and Buffon with delight,\nauthors, in my estimation, of nearly equal interest and utility.",
        "My occupations at this age were principally the mathematics, and most of\nthe branches of study appertaining to that science.",
        "I was busily\nemployed in learning languages; Latin was already familiar to me, and I\nbegan to read some of the easiest Greek authors without the help of a\nlexicon.",
        "I also perfectly understood English and German.",
        "This is the\nlist of my accomplishments at the age of seventeen; and you may conceive\nthat my hours were fully employed in acquiring and maintaining a\nknowledge of this various literature.",
        "Another task also devolved upon me, when I became the instructor of my\nbrothers.",
        "Ernest was six years younger than myself, and was my principal\npupil.",
        "He had been afflicted with ill health from his infancy, through\nwhich Elizabeth and I had been his constant nurses: his disposition was\ngentle, but he was incapable of any severe application.",
        "William, the\nyoungest of our family, was yet an infant, and the most beautiful little\nfellow in the world; his lively blue eyes, dimpled cheeks, and endearing\nmanners, inspired the tenderest affection.",
        "Such was our domestic circle, from which care and pain seemed for ever\nbanished.",
        "My father directed our studies, and my mother partook of our\nenjoyments.",
        "Neither of us possessed the slightest pre-eminence over the\nother; the voice of command was never heard amongst us; but mutual\naffection engaged us all to comply with and obey the slightest desire of\neach other.",
        "CHAPTER II.",
        "When I had attained the age of seventeen, my parents resolved that I\nshould become a student at the university of Ingolstadt.",
        "I had hitherto\nattended the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for\nthe completion of my education, that I should be made acquainted with\nother customs than those of my native country.",
        "My departure was\ntherefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day resolved upon\ncould arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred\u2014an omen, as it\nwere, of my future misery.",
        "Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; but her illness was not severe,\nand she quickly recovered.",
        "During her confinement, many arguments had\nbeen urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her.",
        "She\nhad, at first, yielded to our entreaties; but when she heard that her\nfavourite was recovering, she could no longer debar herself from her\nsociety, and entered her chamber long before the danger of infection was\npast.",
        "The consequences of this imprudence were fatal.",
        "On the third day\nmy mother sickened; her fever was very malignant, and the looks of her\nattendants prognosticated the worst event.",
        "On her death-bed the\nfortitude and benignity of this admirable woman did not desert her.",
        "She\njoined the hands of Elizabeth and myself: \u201cMy children,\u201d she said, \u201cmy\nfirmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your\nunion.",
        "This expectation will now be the consolation of your father.",
        "Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to your younger cousins.",
        "Alas!",
        "I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I\nhave been, is it not hard to quit you all?",
        "But these are not thoughts\nbefitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death, and\nwill indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.\u201d\n\nShe died calmly; and her countenance expressed affection even in death.",
        "I need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by\nthat most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the soul,\nand the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.",
        "It is so long\nbefore the mind can persuade itself that she, whom we saw every day, and\nwhose very existence appeared a part of our own, can have departed for\never\u2014that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished,\nand the sound of a voice so familiar, and dear to the ear, can be\nhushed, never more to be heard.",
        "These are the reflections of the first\ndays; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then\nthe actual bitterness of grief commences.",
        "Yet from whom has not that\nrude hand rent away some dear connexion; and why should I describe a\nsorrow which all have felt, and must feel?",
        "The time at length arrives,\nwhen grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that\nplays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not\nbanished.",
        "My mother was dead, but we had still duties which we ought to\nperform; we must continue our course with the rest, and learn to think\nourselves fortunate, whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized.",
        "My journey to Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was\nnow again determined upon.",
        "I obtained from my father a respite of some\nweeks.",
        "This period was spent sadly; my mother\u2019s death, and my speedy\ndeparture, depressed our spirits; but Elizabeth endeavoured to renew the\nspirit of cheerfulness in our little society.",
        "Since the death of her\naunt, her mind had acquired new firmness and vigour.",
        "She determined to\nfulfil her duties with the greatest exactness; and she felt that that\nmost imperious duty, of rendering her uncle and cousins happy, had\ndevolved upon her.",
        "She consoled me, amused her uncle, instructed my\nbrothers; and I never beheld her so enchanting as at this time, when she\nwas continually endeavouring to contribute to the happiness of others,\nentirely forgetful of herself.",
        "The day of my departure at length arrived.",
        "I had taken leave of all my\nfriends, excepting Clerval, who spent the last evening with us.",
        "He\nbitterly lamented that he was unable to accompany me: but his father\ncould not be persuaded to part with him, intending that he should become\na partner with him in business, in compliance with his favourite theory,\nthat learning was superfluous in the commerce of ordinary life.",
        "Henry\nhad a refined mind; he had no desire to be idle, and was well pleased to\nbecome his father\u2019s partner, but he believed that a man might be a very\ngood trader, and yet possess a cultivated understanding.",
        "We sat late, listening to his complaints, and making many little\narrangements for the future.",
        "The next morning early I departed.",
        "Tears\ngushed from the eyes of Elizabeth; they proceeded partly from sorrow at\nmy departure, and partly because she reflected that the same journey was\nto have taken place three months before, when a mother\u2019s blessing would\nhave accompanied me.",
        "I threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away, and indulged\nin the most melancholy reflections.",
        "I, who had ever been surrounded by\namiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow\nmutual pleasure, I was now alone.",
        "In the university, whither I was\ngoing, I must form my own friends, and be my own protector.",
        "My life had\nhitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic; and this had given me\ninvincible repugnance to new countenances.",
        "I loved my brothers,\nElizabeth, and Clerval; these were \u201cold familiar faces;\u201d but I believed\nmyself totally unfitted for the company of strangers.",
        "Such were my\nreflections as I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits\nand hopes rose.",
        "I ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge.",
        "I had\noften, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up\nin one place, and had longed to enter the world, and take my station\namong other human beings.",
        "Now my desires were complied with, and it\nwould, indeed, have been folly to repent.",
        "I had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my\njourney to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing.",
        "At length the high\nwhite steeple of the town met my eyes.",
        "I alighted, and was conducted to\nmy solitary apartment, to spend the evening as I pleased.",
        "The next morning I delivered my letters of introduction, and paid a\nvisit to some of the principal professors, and among others to M.\nKrempe, professor of natural philosophy.",
        "He received me with politeness,\nand asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different\nbranches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.",
        "I mentioned, it\nis true, with fear and trembling, the only authors I had ever read upon\nthose subjects.",
        "The professor stared: \u201cHave you,\u201d he said, \u201creally spent\nyour time in studying such nonsense?\u201d\n\nI replied in the affirmative.",
        "\u201cEvery minute,\u201d continued M. Krempe with\nwarmth, \u201cevery instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly\nand entirely lost.",
        "You have burdened your memory with exploded systems,\nand useless names.",
        "Good God!",
        "in what desert land have you lived, where\nno one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies, which you have\nso greedily imbibed, are a thousand years old, and as musty as they are\nancient?",
        "I little expected in this enlightened and scientific age to\nfind a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.",
        "My dear Sir, you must\nbegin your studies entirely anew.\u201d\n\nSo saying, he stept aside, and wrote down a list of several books\ntreating of natural philosophy, which he desired me to procure, and\ndismissed me, after mentioning that in the beginning of the following\nweek he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural\nphilosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a\nfellow-professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that\nhe missed.",
        "I returned home, not disappointed, for I had long considered those\nauthors useless whom the professor had so strongly reprobated; but I did\nnot feel much inclined to study the books which I procured at his\nrecommendation.",
        "M. Krempe was a little squat man, with a gruff voice and\nrepulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in\nfavour of his doctrine.",
        "Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern\nnatural philosophy.",
        "It was very different, when the masters of the\nscience sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were\ngrand: but now the scene was changed.",
        "The ambition of the inquirer\nseemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my\ninterest in science was chiefly founded.",
        "I was required to exchange\nchimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.",
        "Such were my reflections during the first two or three days spent almost\nin solitude.",
        "But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the\ninformation which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.",
        "And\nalthough I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow\ndeliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\nWaldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.",
        "Partly from curiosity, and partly from idleness, I went into the\nlecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after.",
        "This professor\nwas very unlike his colleague.",
        "He appeared about fifty years of age, but\nwith an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few gray hairs\ncovered his temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly\nblack.",
        "His person was short, but remarkably erect; and his voice the\nsweetest I had ever heard.",
        "He began his lecture by a recapitulation of\nthe history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different\nmen of learning, pronouncing with fervour the names of the most\ndistinguished discoverers.",
        "He then took a cursory view of the present\nstate of the science, and explained many of its elementary terms.",
        "After\nhaving made a few preparatory experiments, he concluded with a panegyric\nupon modern chemistry, the terms of which I shall never forget:\u2014\n\n\u201cThe ancient teachers of this science,\u201d said he, \u201cpromised\nimpossibilities, and performed nothing.",
        "The modern masters promise very\nlittle; they know that metals cannot be transmuted, and that the elixir\nof life is a chimera.",
        "But these philosophers, whose hands seem only made\nto dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pour over the microscope or\ncrucible, have indeed performed miracles.",
        "They penetrate into the\nrecesses of nature, and shew how she works in her hiding places.",
        "They\nascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates,\nand the nature of the air we breathe.",
        "They have acquired new and almost\nunlimited powers; they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the\nearthquake, and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.\u201d\n\nI departed highly pleased with the professor and his lecture, and paid\nhim a visit the same evening.",
        "His manners in private were even more mild\nand attractive than in public; for there was a certain dignity in his\nmien during his lecture, which in his own house was replaced by the\ngreatest affability and kindness.",
        "He heard with attention my little\nnarration concerning my studies, and smiled at the names of Cornelius\nAgrippa, and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had\nexhibited.",
        "He said, that \u201cthese were men to whose indefatigable zeal\nmodern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their\nknowledge.",
        "They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names,\nand arrange in connected classifications, the facts which they in a\ngreat degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.",
        "The labours\nof men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in\nultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.\u201d I listened to his\nstatement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation;\nand then added, that his lecture had removed my prejudices against\nmodern chemists; and I, at the same time, requested his advice\nconcerning the books I ought to procure.",
        "\u201cI am happy,\u201d said M. Waldman, \u201cto have gained a disciple; and if your\napplication equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success.",
        "Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest\nimprovements have been and may be made; it is on that account that I\nhave made it my peculiar study; but at the same time I have not\nneglected the other branches of science.",
        "A man would make but a very\nsorry chemist, if he attended to that department of human knowledge\nalone.",
        "If your wish is to become really a man of science, and not merely\na petty experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of\nnatural philosophy, including mathematics.\u201d\n\nHe then took me into his laboratory, and explained to me the uses of\nhis various machines; instructing me as to what I ought to procure, and\npromising me the use of his own, when I should have advanced far enough\nin the science not to derange their mechanism.",
        "He also gave me the list\nof books which I had requested; and I took my leave.",
        "Thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.",
        "CHAPTER III.",
        "From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the\nmost comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.",
        "I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,\nwhich modern inquirers have written on these subjects.",
        "I attended the\nlectures, and cultivated the acquaintance, of the men of science of the\nuniversity; and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense\nand real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy\nand manners, but not on that account the less valuable.",
        "In M. Waldman I\nfound a true friend.",
        "His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism; and\nhis instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature,\nthat banished every idea of pedantry.",
        "It was, perhaps, the amiable\ncharacter of this man that inclined me more to that branch of natural\nphilosophy which he professed, than an intrinsic love for the science\nitself.",
        "But this state of mind had place only in the first steps towards\nknowledge: the more fully I entered into the science, the more\nexclusively I pursued it for its own sake.",
        "That application, which at\nfirst had been a matter of duty and resolution, now became so ardent and\neager, that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst\nI was yet engaged in my laboratory.",
        "As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that I improved\nrapidly.",
        "My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students; and my\nproficiency, that of the masters.",
        "Professor Krempe often asked me, with\na sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on?",
        "whilst M. Waldman expressed\nthe most heart-felt exultation in my progress.",
        "Two years passed in this\nmanner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart\nand soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries, which I hoped to make.",
        "None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements\nof science.",
        "In other studies you go as far as others have gone before\nyou, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit\nthere is continual food for discovery and wonder.",
        "A mind of moderate\ncapacity, which closely pursues one study, must infallibly arrive at\ngreat proficiency in that study; and I, who continually sought the\nattainment of one object of pursuit, and was solely wrapt up in this,\nimproved so rapidly, that, at the end of two years, I made some\ndiscoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which\nprocured me great esteem and admiration at the university.",
        "When I had\narrived at this point, and had become as well acquainted with the theory\nand practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of\nthe professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer\nconducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and\nmy native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay.",
        "One of the ph\u00e6nonema which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the\nstructure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with life.",
        "Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?",
        "It was\na bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery;\nyet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted,\nif cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries.",
        "I revolved\nthese circumstances in my mind, and determined thenceforth to apply\nmyself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which\nrelate to physiology.",
        "Unless I had been animated by an almost\nsupernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been\nirksome, and almost intolerable.",
        "To examine the causes of life, we must\nfirst have recourse to death.",
        "I became acquainted with the science of\nanatomy: but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural\ndecay and corruption of the human body.",
        "In my education my father had\ntaken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no\nsupernatural horrors.",
        "I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale\nof superstition, or to have feared the apparition of a spirit.",
        "Darkness\nhad no effect upon my fancy; and a church-yard was to me merely the\nreceptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of\nbeauty and strength, had become food for the worm.",
        "Now I was led to\nexamine the cause and progress of this decay, and forced to spend days\nand nights in vaults and charnel houses.",
        "My attention was fixed upon\nevery object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human\nfeelings.",
        "I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I\nbeheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I\nsaw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain.",
        "I paused,\nexamining and analysing all the minuti\u00e6 of causation, as exemplified in\nthe change from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst\nof this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me\u2014a light so brilliant\nand wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the\nimmensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that\namong so many men of genius, who had directed their inquiries towards\nthe same science, that I alone should be reserved to discover so\nastonishing a secret.",
        "Remember, I am not recording the vision of a madman.",
        "The sun does not\nmore certainly shine in the heavens, than that which I now affirm is\ntrue.",
        "Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the\ndiscovery were distinct and probable.",
        "After days and nights of\nincredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of\ngeneration and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing\nanimation upon lifeless matter.",
        "The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon\ngave place to delight and rapture.",
        "After so much time spent in painful\nlabour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires, was the most\ngratifying consummation of my toils.",
        "But this discovery was so great\nand overwhelming, that all the steps by which I had been progressively\nled to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.",
        "What had been\nthe study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world,\nwas now within my grasp.",
        "Not that, like a magic scene, it all opened\nupon me at once: the information I had obtained was of a nature rather\nto direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them towards the\nobject of my search, than to exhibit that object already accomplished.",
        "I\nwas like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead, and found a\npassage to life aided only by one glimmering, and seemingly ineffectual\nlight.",
        "I see by your eagerness, and the wonder and hope which your eyes\nexpress, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with\nwhich I am acquainted; that cannot be: listen patiently until the end of\nmy story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that\nsubject.",
        "I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to\nyour destruction and infallible misery.",
        "Learn from me, if not by my\nprecepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of\nknowledge, and how much happier that man is who believes his native town\nto be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature\nwill allow.",
        "When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated\na long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.",
        "Although\nI possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame\nfor the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles,\nand veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour.",
        "I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being like\nmyself or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much\nexalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give\nlife to an animal as complex and wonderful as man.",
        "The materials at\npresent within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an\nundertaking; but I doubted not that I should ultimately succeed.",
        "I\nprepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be\nincessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect: yet, when I\nconsidered the improvement which every day takes place in science and\nmechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least\nlay the foundations of future success.",
        "Nor could I consider the\nmagnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its\nimpracticability.",
        "It was with these feelings that I began the creation\nof a human being.",
        "As the minuteness of the parts formed a great\nhindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to\nmake the being of a gigantic stature; that is to say, about eight feet\nin height, and proportionably large.",
        "After having formed this\ndetermination, and having spent some months in successfully collecting\nand arranging my materials, I began.",
        "No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like\na hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success.",
        "Life and death appeared\nto me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a\ntorrent of light into our dark world.",
        "A new species would bless me as\nits creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their\nbeing to me.",
        "No father could claim the gratitude of his child so\ncompletely as I should deserve their\u2019s.",
        "Pursuing these reflections, I\nthought, that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might\nin process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where\ndeath had apparently devoted the body to corruption.",
        "These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking with\nunremitting ardour.",
        "My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person\nhad become emaciated with confinement.",
        "Sometimes, on the very brink of\ncertainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or\nthe next hour might realize.",
        "One secret which I alone possessed was the\nhope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight\nlabours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued\nnature to her hiding places.",
        "Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret\ntoil, as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave, or tortured\nthe living animal to animate the lifeless clay?",
        "My limbs now tremble,\nand my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless, and almost\nfrantic impulse, urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or\nsensation but for this one pursuit.",
        "It was indeed but a passing trance,\nthat only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural\nstimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits.",
        "I\ncollected bones from charnel houses; and disturbed, with profane\nfingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame.",
        "In a solitary\nchamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all\nthe other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of\nfilthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in\nattending to the details of my employment.",
        "The dissecting room and the\nslaughter-house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human\nnature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by\nan eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a\nconclusion.",
        "The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in\none pursuit.",
        "It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow\na more plentiful harvest, or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage:\nbut my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.",
        "And the same\nfeelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to\nforget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not\nseen for so long a time.",
        "I knew my silence disquieted them; and I well\nremembered the words of my father: \u201cI know that while you are pleased\nwith yourself, you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear\nregularly from you.",
        "You must pardon me, if I regard any interruption in\nyour correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally\nneglected.\u201d\n\nI knew well therefore what would be my father\u2019s feelings; but I could\nnot tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which\nhad taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.",
        "I wished, as it were,\nto procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the\ngreat object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be\ncompleted.",
        "I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect\nto vice, or faultiness on my part; but I am now convinced that he was\njustified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame.",
        "A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful\nmind, and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his\ntranquillity.",
        "I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an\nexception to this rule.",
        "If the study to which you apply yourself has a\ntendency to weaken your affections, and to destroy your taste for those\nsimple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is\ncertainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind.",
        "If\nthis rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit\nwhatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic\naffections, Greece had not been enslaved; C\u00e6sar would have spared his\ncountry; America would have been discovered more gradually; and the\nempires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.",
        "But I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my\ntale; and your looks remind me to proceed.",
        "My father made no reproach in his letters; and only took notice of my\nsilence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.",
        "Winter, spring, and summer, passed away during my labours; but I did not\nwatch the blossom or the expanding leaves\u2014sights which before always\nyielded me supreme delight, so deeply was I engrossed in my occupation.",
        "The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a\nclose; and now every day shewed me more plainly how well I had\nsucceeded.",
        "But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared\nrather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other\nunwholesome trade, than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.",
        "Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a\nmost painful degree; a disease that I regretted the more because I had\nhitherto enjoyed most excellent health, and had always boasted of the\nfirmness of my nerves.",
        "But I believed that exercise and amusement would\nsoon drive away such symptoms; and I promised myself both of these, when\nmy creation should be complete.",
        "CHAPTER IV.",
        "It was on a dreary night of November, that I beheld the accomplishment\nof my toils.",
        "With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected\nthe instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being\ninto the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.",
        "It was already one in the\nmorning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was\nnearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I\nsaw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a\nconvulsive motion agitated its limbs.",
        "How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the\nwretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form?",
        "His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\nbeautiful.",
        "Beautiful!\u2014Great God!",
        "His yellow skin scarcely covered the\nwork of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black,\nand flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only\nformed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost\nof the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his\nshrivelled complexion, and straight black lips.",
        "The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of\nhuman nature.",
        "I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole\npurpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.",
        "For this I had deprived\nmyself of rest and health.",
        "I had desired it with an ardour that far\nexceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the\ndream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.",
        "Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of\nthe room, and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable\nto compose my mind to sleep.",
        "At length lassitude succeeded to the\ntumult I had before endured; and I threw myself on the bed in my\nclothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.",
        "But it was\nin vain: I slept indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams.",
        "I\nthought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets\nof Ingolstadt.",
        "Delighted and surprised, I embraced her; but as I\nimprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of\ndeath; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the\ncorpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I\nsaw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.",
        "I started from\nmy sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth\nchattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow\nlight of the moon, as it forced its way through the window-shutters, I\nbeheld the wretch\u2014the miserable monster whom I had created.",
        "He held up\nthe curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were\nfixed on me.",
        "His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds,\nwhile a grin wrinkled his cheeks.",
        "He might have spoken, but I did not\nhear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped,\nand rushed down stairs.",
        "I took refuge in the court-yard belonging to the\nhouse which I inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the night,\nwalking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively,\ncatching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach\nof the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.",
        "Oh!",
        "no mortal could support the horror of that countenance.",
        "A mummy\nagain endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.",
        "I\nhad gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then; but when those\nmuscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing\nsuch as even Dante could not have conceived.",
        "I passed the night wretchedly.",
        "Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and\nhardly, that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly\nsank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.",
        "Mingled with\nthis horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment: dreams that had\nbeen my food and pleasant rest for so long a space, were now become a\nhell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!",
        "Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned, and discovered to my\nsleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple\nand clock, which indicated the sixth hour.",
        "The porter opened the gates\nof the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the\nstreets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the\nwretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my\nview.",
        "I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt\nimpelled to hurry on, although wetted by the rain, which poured from a\nblack and comfortless sky.",
        "I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by\nbodily exercise, to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.",
        "I\ntraversed the streets, without any clear conception of where I was, or\nwhat I was doing.",
        "My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear; and I\nhurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:\n\n    Like one who, on a lonely road,\n      Doth walk in fear and dread,\n    And, having once turn\u2019d round, walks on,\n      And turns no more his head;\n    Because he knows a frightful fiend\n      Doth close behind him tread.",
        "Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the\nvarious diligences and carriages usually stopped.",
        "Here I paused, I knew\nnot why; but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that\nwas coming towards me from the other end of the street.",
        "As it drew\nnearer, I observed that it was the Swiss diligence: it stopped just\nwhere I was standing; and, on the door being opened, I perceived Henry\nClerval, who, on seeing me, instantly sprung out.",
        "\u201cMy dear\nFrankenstein,\u201d exclaimed he, \u201chow glad I am to see you!",
        "how fortunate\nthat you should be here at the very moment of my alighting!\u201d\n\nNothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought\nback to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home\nso dear to my recollection.",
        "I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot\nmy horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during\nmany months, calm and serene joy.",
        "I welcomed my friend, therefore, in\nthe most cordial manner, and we walked towards my college.",
        "Clerval\ncontinued talking for some time about our mutual friends, and his own\ngood fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt.",
        "\u201cYou may easily\nbelieve,\u201d said he, \u201chow great was the difficulty to persuade my father\nthat it was not absolutely necessary for a merchant not to understand\nany thing except book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him\nincredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied\nentreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in the Vicar\nof Wakefield: \u2018I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat\nheartily without Greek.\u2019 But his affection for me at length overcame his\ndislike of learning, and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of\ndiscovery to the land of knowledge.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left\nmy father, brothers, and Elizabeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from you\nso seldom.",
        "By the bye, I mean to lecture you a little upon their account\nmyself.\u2014But, my dear Frankenstein,\u201d continued he, stopping short, and\ngazing full in my face, \u201cI did not before remark how very ill you\nappear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for\nseveral nights.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one\noccupation, that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see:\nbut I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an\nend, and that I am at length free.\u201d\n\nI trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to\nallude to the occurrences of the preceding night.",
        "I walked with a quick\npace, and we soon arrived at my college.",
        "I then reflected, and the\nthought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my\napartment might still be there, alive, and walking about.",
        "I dreaded to\nbehold this monster; but I feared still more that Henry should see him.",
        "Entreating him therefore to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the\nstairs, I darted up towards my own room.",
        "My hand was already on the lock\nof the door before I recollected myself.",
        "I then paused; and a cold\nshivering came over me.",
        "I threw the door forcibly open, as children are\naccustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them\non the other side; but nothing appeared.",
        "I stepped fearfully in: the\napartment was empty; and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous\nguest.",
        "I could hardly believe that so great a good-fortune could have\nbefallen me; but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I\nclapped my hands for joy, and ran down to Clerval.",
        "We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;\nbut I was unable to contain myself.",
        "It was not joy only that possessed\nme; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse\nbeat rapidly.",
        "I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same\nplace; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.",
        "Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival;\nbut when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes\nfor which he could not account; and my loud, unrestrained, heartless\nlaughter, frightened and astonished him.",
        "\u201cMy dear Victor,\u201d cried he, \u201cwhat, for God\u2019s sake, is the matter?",
        "Do not\nlaugh in that manner.",
        "How ill you are!",
        "What is the cause of all this?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not ask me,\u201d cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought\nI saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; \u201c_he_ can tell.\u2014Oh, save\nme!",
        "save me!\u201d I imagined that the monster seized me; I struggled\nfuriously, and fell down in a fit.",
        "Poor Clerval!",
        "what must have been his feelings?",
        "A meeting, which he\nanticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness.",
        "But I was\nnot the witness of his grief; for I was lifeless, and did not recover my\nsenses for a long, long time.",
        "This was the commencement of a nervous fever, which confined me for\nseveral months.",
        "During all that time Henry was my only nurse.",
        "I\nafterwards learned that, knowing my father\u2019s advanced age, and unfitness\nfor so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make\nElizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my\ndisorder.",
        "He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive nurse\nthan himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he did not\ndoubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest action that\nhe could towards them.",
        "But I was in reality very ill; and surely nothing but the unbounded and\nunremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.",
        "The\nform of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before\nmy eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.",
        "Doubtless my words\nsurprised Henry: he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my\ndisturbed imagination; but the pertinacity with which I continually\nrecurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed\nits origin to some uncommon and terrible event.",
        "By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses, that alarmed and\ngrieved my friend, I recovered.",
        "I remember the first time I became\ncapable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I\nperceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared, and that the young\nbuds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.",
        "It was a\ndivine spring; and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence.",
        "I\nfelt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom\ndisappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was\nattacked by the fatal passion.",
        "\u201cDearest Clerval,\u201d exclaimed I, \u201chow kind, how very good you are to me.",
        "This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised\nyourself, has been consumed in my sick room.",
        "How shall I ever repay\nyou?",
        "I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I have\nbeen the occasion; but you will forgive me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will repay me entirely, if you do not discompose yourself, but get\nwell as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I\nmay speak to you on one subject, may I not?\u201d\n\nI trembled.",
        "One subject!",
        "what could it be?",
        "Could he allude to an object\non whom I dared not even think?",
        "\u201cCompose yourself,\u201d said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, \u201cI\nwill not mention it, if it agitates you; but your father and cousin\nwould be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own\nhand-writing.",
        "They hardly know how ill you have been, and are uneasy at\nyour long silence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that all?",
        "my dear Henry.",
        "How could you suppose that my first thought\nwould not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love, and who are\nso deserving of my love.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad to\nsee a letter that has been lying here some days for you: it is from your\ncousin, I believe.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n\nClerval then put the following letter into my hands.",
        "*       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201c_To_ V. FRANKENSTEIN.",
        "\u201cMY DEAR COUSIN,\n\n\u201cI cannot describe to you the uneasiness we have all felt concerning\nyour health.",
        "We cannot help imagining that your friend Clerval conceals\nthe extent of your disorder: for it is now several months since we have\nseen your hand-writing; and all this time you have been obliged to\ndictate your letters to Henry.",
        "Surely, Victor, you must have been\nexceedingly ill; and this makes us all very wretched, as much so nearly\nas after the death of your dear mother.",
        "My uncle was almost persuaded\nthat you were indeed dangerously ill, and could hardly be restrained\nfrom undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.",
        "Clerval always writes that you\nare getting better; I eagerly hope that you will confirm this\nintelligence soon in your own hand-writing; for indeed, indeed, Victor,\nwe are all very miserable on this account.",
        "Relieve us from this fear,\nand we shall be the happiest creatures in the world.",
        "Your father\u2019s\nhealth is now so vigorous, that he appears ten years younger since last\nwinter.",
        "Ernest also is so much improved, that you would hardly know him:\nhe is now nearly sixteen, and has lost that sickly appearance which he\nhad some years ago; he is grown quite robust and active.",
        "\u201cMy uncle and I conversed a long time last night about what profession\nErnest should follow.",
        "His constant illness when young has deprived him\nof the habits of application; and now that he enjoys good health, he is\ncontinually in the open air, climbing the hills, or rowing on the lake.",
        "I therefore proposed that he should be a farmer; which you know, Cousin,\nis a favourite scheme of mine.",
        "A farmer\u2019s is a very healthy happy life;\nand the least hurtful, or rather the most beneficial profession of any.",
        "My uncle had an idea of his being educated as an advocate, that through\nhis interest he might become a judge.",
        "But, besides that he is not at all\nfitted for such an occupation, it is certainly more creditable to\ncultivate the earth for the sustenance of man, than to be the confidant,\nand sometimes the accomplice, of his vices; which is the profession of a\nlawyer.",
        "I said, that the employments of a prosperous farmer, if they\nwere not a more honourable, they were at least a happier species of\noccupation than that of a judge, whose misfortune it was always to\nmeddle with the dark side of human nature.",
        "My uncle smiled, and said,\nthat I ought to be an advocate myself, which put an end to the\nconversation on that subject.",
        "\u201cAnd now I must tell you a little story that will please, and perhaps\namuse you.",
        "Do you not remember Justine Moritz?",
        "Probably you do not; I\nwill relate her history, therefore, in a few words.",
        "Madame Moritz, her\nmother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third.",
        "This girl had always been the favourite of her father; but, through a\nstrange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and, after the\ndeath of M. Moritz, treated her very ill.",
        "My aunt observed this; and,\nwhen Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow\nher to live at her house.",
        "The republican institutions of our country\nhave produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in\nthe great monarchies that surround it.",
        "Hence there is less distinction\nbetween the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders\nbeing neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined\nand moral.",
        "A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant\nin France and England.",
        "Justine, thus received in our family, learned the\nduties of a servant; a condition which, in our fortunate country, does\nnot include the idea of ignorance, and a sacrifice of the dignity of a\nhuman being.",
        "\u201cAfter what I have said, I dare say you well remember the heroine of my\nlittle tale: for Justine was a great favourite of your\u2019s; and I\nrecollect you once remarked, that if you were in an ill-humour, one\nglance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto\ngives concerning the beauty of Angelica\u2014she looked so frank-hearted and\nhappy.",
        "My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was\ninduced to give her an education superior to that which she had at\nfirst intended.",
        "This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most\ngrateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any\nprofessions, I never heard one pass her lips; but you could see by her\neyes that she almost adored her protectress.",
        "Although her disposition\nwas gay, and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest\nattention to every gesture of my aunt.",
        "She thought her the model of all\nexcellence, and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so\nthat even now she often reminds me of her.",
        "\u201cWhen my dearest aunt died, every one was too much occupied in their own\ngrief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness\nwith the most anxious affection.",
        "Poor Justine was very ill; but other\ntrials were reserved for her.",
        "\u201cOne by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the\nexception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.",
        "The conscience\nof the woman was troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her\nfavourites was a judgment from heaven to chastise her partiality.",
        "She\nwas a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea\nwhich she had conceived.",
        "Accordingly, a few months after your departure\nfor Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother.",
        "Poor\ngirl!",
        "she wept when she quitted our house: she was much altered since\nthe death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to\nher manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity.",
        "Nor was her\nresidence at her mother\u2019s house of a nature to restore her gaiety.",
        "The\npoor woman was very vacillating in her repentance.",
        "She sometimes begged\nJustine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of\nhaving caused the deaths of her brothers and sister.",
        "Perpetual fretting\nat length threw Madame Moritz into a decline, which at first increased\nher irritability, but she is now at peace for ever.",
        "She died on the\nfirst approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter.",
        "Justine has returned to us; and I assure you I love her tenderly.",
        "She is\nvery clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her\nmien and her expressions continually remind me of my dear aunt.",
        "\u201cI must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling\nWilliam.",
        "I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with\nsweet laughing blue eyes, dark eye-lashes, and curling hair.",
        "When he\nsmiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with\nhealth.",
        "He has already had one or two little _wives_, but Louisa Biron\nis his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.",
        "\u201cNow, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip\nconcerning the good people of Geneva.",
        "The pretty Miss Mansfield has\nalready received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage\nwith a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq.",
        "Her ugly sister, Manon,\nmarried M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn.",
        "Your favourite\nschoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the\ndeparture of Clerval from Geneva.",
        "But he has already recovered his\nspirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a very lively\npretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.",
        "She is a widow, and much older\nthan Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with every\nbody.",
        "\u201cI have written myself into good spirits, dear cousin; yet I cannot\nconclude without again anxiously inquiring concerning your health.",
        "Dear\nVictor, if you are not very ill, write yourself, and make your father\nand all of us happy; or\u2014\u2014I cannot bear to think of the other side of\nthe question; my tears already flow.",
        "Adieu, my dearest cousin.\u201d\n\n\u201cELIZABETH LAVENZA.",
        "\u201cGeneva, March 18th, 17\u2014.\u201d\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201cDear, dear Elizabeth!\u201d I exclaimed when I had read her letter, \u201cI will\nwrite instantly, and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel.\u201d I\nwrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had\ncommenced, and proceeded regularly.",
        "In another fortnight I was able to\nleave my chamber.",
        "One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the\nseveral professors of the university.",
        "In doing this, I underwent a kind\nof rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained.",
        "Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of\nmy misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of\nnatural philosophy.",
        "When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the\nsight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous\nsymptoms.",
        "Henry saw this, and had removed all my apparatus from my view.",
        "He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a\ndislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory.",
        "But these\ncares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors.",
        "M.\nWaldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the\nastonishing progress I had made in the sciences.",
        "He soon perceived that\nI disliked the subject; but, not guessing the real cause, he attributed\nmy feelings to modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement to\nthe science itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me\nout.",
        "What could I do?",
        "He meant to please, and he tormented me.",
        "I felt as\nif he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments\nwhich were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel\ndeath.",
        "I writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.",
        "Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the\nsensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his\ntotal ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.",
        "I\nthanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.",
        "I saw plainly that\nhe was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and\nalthough I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew\nno bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide to him that\nevent which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared\nthe detail to another would only impress more deeply.",
        "M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of\nalmost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me\neven more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman.",
        "\u201cD\u2014n the\nfellow!\u201d cried he; \u201cwhy, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstript us\nall.",
        "Aye, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true.",
        "A youngster\nwho, but a few years ago, believed Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as the\ngospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is\nnot soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.\u2014Aye, aye,\u201d\ncontinued he, observing my face expressive of suffering, \u201cM.",
        "Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.",
        "Young men\nshould be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval; I was myself\nwhen young: but that wears out in a very short time.\u201d\n\nM. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned\nthe conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.",
        "Clerval was no natural philosopher.",
        "His imagination was too vivid for\nthe minuti\u00e6 of science.",
        "Languages were his principal study; and he\nsought, by acquiring their elements, to open a field for\nself-instruction on his return to Geneva.",
        "Persian, Arabic, and Hebrew,\ngained his attention, after he had made himself perfectly master of\nGreek and Latin.",
        "For my own part, idleness had ever been irksome to me;\nand now that I wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former\nstudies, I felt great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend,\nand found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the\norientalists.",
        "Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating to a\ndegree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country.",
        "When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and\ngarden of roses,\u2014in the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy, and the fire\nthat consumes your own heart.",
        "How different from the manly and heroical\npoetry of Greece and Rome.",
        "Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was\nfixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several\naccidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,\nand my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.",
        "I felt this delay\nvery bitterly; for I longed to see my native town, and my beloved\nfriends.",
        "My return had only been delayed so long from an unwillingness\nto leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become acquainted\nwith any of its inhabitants.",
        "The winter, however, was spent cheerfully;\nand although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came, its beauty\ncompensated for its dilatoriness.",
        "The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily\nwhich was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a\npedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt that I might bid a\npersonal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited.",
        "I acceded\nwith pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval\nhad always been my favourite companion in the rambles of this nature\nthat I had taken among the scenes of my native country.",
        "We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits had\nlong been restored, and they gained additional strength from the\nsalubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and\nthe conversation of my friend.",
        "Study had before secluded me from the\nintercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but\nClerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me\nto love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.",
        "Excellent friend!",
        "how sincerely did you love me, and endeavour to\nelevate my mind, until it was on a level with your own.",
        "A selfish\npursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection\nwarmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few\nyears ago, loving and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.",
        "When happy,\ninanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful\nsensations.",
        "A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstacy.",
        "The\npresent season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the\nhedges, while those of summer were already in bud: I was undisturbed by\nthoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me,\nnotwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible\nburden.",
        "Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathized in my feelings:\nhe exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that\nfilled his soul.",
        "The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly\nastonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often,\nin imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of\nwonderful fancy and passion.",
        "At other times he repeated my favourite\npoems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great\ningenuity.",
        "We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were\ndancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy.",
        "My own spirits\nwere high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and\nhilarity.",
        "CHAPTER VI.",
        "On my return, I found the following letter from my father:\u2014\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201c_To_ V. FRANKENSTEIN.",
        "\u201cMY DEAR VICTOR,\n\n\u201cYou have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of\nyour return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines,\nmerely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.",
        "But that would\nbe a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.",
        "What would be your surprise,\nmy son, when you expected a happy and gay welcome, to behold, on the\ncontrary, tears and wretchedness?",
        "And how, Victor, can I relate our\nmisfortune?",
        "Absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and\ngriefs; and how shall I inflict pain on an absent child?",
        "I wish to\nprepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now\nyour eye skims over the page, to seek the words which are to convey to\nyou the horrible tidings.",
        "\u201cWilliam is dead!\u2014that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed\nmy heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay!",
        "Victor, he is murdered!",
        "\u201cI will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the\ncircumstances of the transaction.",
        "\u201cLast Thursday (May 7th) I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to\nwalk in Plainpalais.",
        "The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged\nour walk farther than usual.",
        "It was already dusk before we thought of\nreturning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone\non before, were not to be found.",
        "We accordingly rested on a seat until\nthey should return.",
        "Presently Ernest came, and inquired if we had seen\nhis brother: he said, that they had been playing together, that William\nhad run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and\nafterwards waited for him a long time, but that he did not return.",
        "\u201cThis account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him\nuntil night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned\nto the house.",
        "He was not there.",
        "We returned again, with torches; for I\ncould not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had lost himself, and\nwas exposed to all the damps and dews of night: Elizabeth also suffered\nextreme anguish.",
        "About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy,\nwhom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health,\nstretched on the grass livid and motionless: the print of the murderer\u2019s\nfinger was on his neck.",
        "\u201cHe was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my\ncountenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth.",
        "She was very earnest to\nsee the corpse.",
        "At first I attempted to prevent her; but she persisted,\nand entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the\nvictim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, \u2018O God!",
        "I have murdered my\ndarling infant!\u2019\n\n\u201cShe fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty.",
        "When she again\nlived, it was only to weep and sigh.",
        "She told me, that that same evening\nWilliam had teazed her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that\nshe possessed of your mother.",
        "This picture is gone, and was doubtless\nthe temptation which urged the murderer to the deed.",
        "We have no trace of\nhim at present, although our exertions to discover him are unremitted;\nbut they will not restore my beloved William.",
        "\u201cCome, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth.",
        "She weeps\ncontinually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her\nwords pierce my heart.",
        "We are all unhappy; but will not that be an\nadditional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?",
        "Your\ndear mother!",
        "Alas, Victor!",
        "I now say, Thank God she did not live to\nwitness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!",
        "\u201cCome, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,\nbut with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of\nfestering the wounds of our minds.",
        "Enter the house of mourning, my\nfriend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not\nwith hatred for your enemies.",
        "\u201cYour affectionate and afflicted father,\n\n\u201cALPHONSE FRANKENSTEIN.",
        "\u201cGeneva, May 12th, 17\u2014.\u201d\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was\nsurprised to observe the despair that succeeded to the joy I at first\nexpressed on receiving news from my friends.",
        "I threw the letter on the\ntable, and covered my face with my hands.",
        "\u201cMy dear Frankenstein,\u201d exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me weep with\nbitterness, \u201care you always to be unhappy?",
        "My dear friend, what has\nhappened?\u201d\n\nI motioned to him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the\nroom in the extremest agitation.",
        "Tears also gushed from the eyes of\nClerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.",
        "\u201cI can offer you no consolation, my friend,\u201d said he; \u201cyour disaster is\nirreparable.",
        "What do you intend to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.\u201d\n\nDuring our walk, Clerval endeavoured to raise my spirits.",
        "He did not do\nthis by common topics of consolation, but by exhibiting the truest\nsympathy.",
        "\u201cPoor William!\u201d said he, \u201cthat dear child; he now sleeps with\nhis angel mother.",
        "His friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest: he does\nnot now feel the murderer\u2019s grasp; a sod covers his gentle form, and he\nknows no pain.",
        "He can no longer be a fit subject for pity; the survivors\nare the greatest sufferers, and for them time is the only consolation.",
        "Those maxims of the Stoics, that death was no evil, and that the mind of\nman ought to be superior to despair on the eternal absence of a beloved\nobject, ought not to be urged.",
        "Even Cato wept over the dead body of his\nbrother.\u201d\n\nClerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words\nimpressed themselves on my mind, and I remembered them afterwards in\nsolitude.",
        "But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a\ncabriole, and bade farewell to my friend.",
        "My journey was very melancholy.",
        "At first I wished to hurry on, for I\nlonged to console and sympathize with my loved and sorrowing friends;\nbut when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress.",
        "I could\nhardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind.",
        "I\npassed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for\nnearly six years.",
        "How altered every thing might be during that time?",
        "One\nsudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little\ncircumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations which,\nalthough they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive.",
        "Fear overcame me; I dared not advance, dreading a thousand nameless\nevils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them.",
        "I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind.",
        "I\ncontemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm, and\nthe snowy mountains, \u201cthe palaces of nature,\u201d were not changed.",
        "By\ndegrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my\njourney towards Geneva.",
        "The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I\napproached my native town.",
        "I discovered more distinctly the black sides\nof Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Bl\u00e2nc; I wept like a child: \u201cDear\nmountains!",
        "my own beautiful lake!",
        "how do you welcome your wanderer?",
        "Your\nsummits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid.",
        "Is this to\nprognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?\u201d\n\nI fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on\nthese preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative\nhappiness, and I think of them with pleasure.",
        "My country, my beloved\ncountry!",
        "who but a native can tell the delight I took in again beholding\nthy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake.",
        "Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me.",
        "Night also\nclosed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt\nstill more gloomily.",
        "The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil,\nand I foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched\nof human beings.",
        "Alas!",
        "I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single\ncircumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not\nconceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.",
        "It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the\ngates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night\nat Secheron, a village half a league to the east of the city.",
        "The sky\nwas serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot\nwhere my poor William had been murdered.",
        "As I could not pass through the\ntown, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at\nPlainpalais.",
        "During this short voyage I saw the lightnings playing on\nthe summit of Mont Bl\u00e2nc in the most beautiful figures.",
        "The storm\nappeared to approach rapidly; and, on landing, I ascended a low hill,\nthat I might observe its progress.",
        "It advanced; the heavens were\nclouded, and I soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops, but its\nviolence quickly increased.",
        "I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm\nincreased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash\nover my head.",
        "It was echoed from Sal\u00eave, the Juras, and the Alps of\nSavoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the\nlake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant\nevery thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself\nfrom the preceding flash.",
        "The storm, as is often the case in\nSwitzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.",
        "The most\nviolent storm hung exactly north of the town, over that part of the lake\nwhich lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of Cop\u00eat.",
        "Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another darkened\nand sometimes disclosed the M\u00f4le, a peaked mountain to the east of the\nlake.",
        "While I watched the storm, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with\na hasty step.",
        "This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped\nmy hands, and exclaimed aloud, \u201cWilliam, dear angel!",
        "this is thy\nfuneral, this thy dirge!\u201d As I said these words, I perceived in the\ngloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood\nfixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken.",
        "A flash of lightning\nilluminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its\ngigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect, more hideous than\nbelongs to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the\nfilthy d\u00e6mon to whom I had given life.",
        "What did he there?",
        "Could he be (I\nshuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother?",
        "No sooner did\nthat idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my\nteeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support.",
        "The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom.",
        "Nothing in\nhuman shape could have destroyed that fair child.",
        "_He_ was the murderer!",
        "I could not doubt it.",
        "The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible\nproof of the fact.",
        "I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have\nbeen in vain, for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the\nrocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of Mont Sal\u00eave, a hill that\nbounds Plainpalais on the south.",
        "He soon reached the summit, and\ndisappeared.",
        "I remained motionless.",
        "The thunder ceased; but the rain still continued,\nand the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.",
        "I revolved in\nmy mind the events which I had until now sought to forget: the whole\ntrain of my progress towards the creation; the appearance of the work of\nmy own hands alive at my bed side; its departure.",
        "Two years had now\nnearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was\nthis his first crime?",
        "Alas!",
        "I had turned loose into the world a depraved\nwretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my\nbrother?",
        "No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the\nnight, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air.",
        "But I did not feel\nthe inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of\nevil and despair.",
        "I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind,\nand endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such\nas the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own\nvampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy\nall that was dear to me.",
        "Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.",
        "The gates were\nopen; and I hastened to my father\u2019s house.",
        "My first thought was to\ndiscover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be\nmade.",
        "But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell.",
        "A\nbeing whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at\nmidnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.",
        "I remembered\nalso the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time\nthat I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a\ntale otherwise so utterly improbable.",
        "I well knew that if any other had\ncommunicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the\nravings of insanity.",
        "Besides, the strange nature of the animal would\nelude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my\nrelatives to commence it.",
        "Besides, of what use would be pursuit?",
        "Who\ncould arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont\nSal\u00eave?",
        "These reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain\nsilent.",
        "It was about five in the morning when I entered my father\u2019s house.",
        "I\ntold the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library\nto attend their usual hour of rising.",
        "Six years had elapsed, passed as a dream but for one indelible trace,\nand I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before\nmy departure for Ingolstadt.",
        "Beloved and respectable parent!",
        "He still\nremained to me.",
        "I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over\nthe mantle-piece.",
        "It was an historical subject, painted at my father\u2019s\ndesire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair,\nkneeling by the coffin of her dead father.",
        "Her garb was rustic, and her\ncheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly\npermitted the sentiment of pity.",
        "Below this picture was a miniature of\nWilliam; and my tears flowed when I looked upon it.",
        "While I was thus\nengaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome\nme.",
        "He expressed a sorrowful delight to see me: \u201cWelcome, my dearest\nVictor,\u201d said he.",
        "\u201cAh!",
        "I wish you had come three months ago, and then\nyou would have found us all joyous and delighted.",
        "But we are now\nunhappy; and, I am afraid, tears instead of smiles will be your welcome.",
        "Our father looks so sorrowful: this dreadful event seems to have revived\nin his mind his grief on the death of Mamma.",
        "Poor Elizabeth also is\nquite inconsolable.\u201d Ernest began to weep as he said these words.",
        "\u201cDo not,\u201d said I, \u201cwelcome me thus; try to be more calm, that I may not\nbe absolutely miserable the moment I enter my father\u2019s house after so\nlong an absence.",
        "But, tell me, how does my father support his\nmisfortunes?",
        "and how is my poor Elizabeth?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe indeed requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused\nthe death of my brother, and that made her very wretched.",
        "But since the\nmurderer has been discovered\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe murderer discovered!",
        "Good God!",
        "how can that be?",
        "who could attempt\nto pursue him?",
        "It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the\nwinds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know what you mean; but we were all very unhappy when she was\ndiscovered.",
        "No one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth\nwill not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.",
        "Indeed, who\nwould credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all\nthe family, could all at once become so extremely wicked?\u201d\n\n\u201cJustine Moritz!",
        "Poor, poor girl, is she the accused?",
        "But it is\nwrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have\nalmost forced conviction upon us: and her own behaviour has been so\nconfused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,\nleaves no hope for doubt.",
        "But she will be tried to-day, and you will\nthen hear all.\u201d\n\nHe related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William had\nbeen discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her bed;\nand, after several days, one of the servants, happening to examine the\napparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her\npocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the\ntemptation of the murderer.",
        "The servant instantly shewed it to one of\nthe others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a\nmagistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended.",
        "On\nbeing charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a\ngreat measure by her extreme confusion of manner.",
        "This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied\nearnestly, \u201cYou are all mistaken; I know the murderer.",
        "Justine, poor,\ngood Justine, is innocent.\u201d\n\nAt that instant my father entered.",
        "I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on\nhis countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after\nwe had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other\ntopic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, \u201cGood God,\nPapa!",
        "Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do also, unfortunately,\u201d replied my father; \u201cfor indeed I had rather\nhave been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and\ningratitude in one I valued so highly.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty.",
        "She is to be\ntried to-day, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.\u201d\n\nThis speech calmed me.",
        "I was firmly convinced in my own mind that\nJustine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.",
        "I\nhad no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be\nbrought forward strong enough to convict her; and, in this assurance, I\ncalmed myself, expecting the trial with eagerness, but without\nprognosticating an evil result.",
        "We were soon joined by Elizabeth.",
        "Time had made great alterations in her\nform since I had last beheld her.",
        "Six years before she had been a\npretty, good-humoured girl, whom every one loved and caressed.",
        "She was\nnow a woman in stature and expression of countenance, which was\nuncommonly lovely.",
        "An open and capacious forehead gave indications of a\ngood understanding, joined to great frankness of disposition.",
        "Her eyes\nwere hazel, and expressive of mildness, now through recent affliction\nallied to sadness.",
        "Her hair was of a rich, dark auburn, her complexion\nfair, and her figure slight and graceful.",
        "She welcomed me with the\ngreatest affection.",
        "\u201cYour arrival, my dear cousin,\u201d said she, \u201cfills me\nwith hope.",
        "You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless\nJustine.",
        "Alas!",
        "who is safe, if she be convicted of crime?",
        "I rely on her\ninnocence as certainly as I do upon my own.",
        "Our misfortune is doubly\nhard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor\ngirl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate.",
        "If\nshe is condemned, I never shall know joy more.",
        "But she will not, I am\nsure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad\ndeath of my little William.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is innocent, my Elizabeth,\u201d said I, \u201cand that shall be proved;\nfear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her\nacquittal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow kind you are!",
        "every one else believes in her guilt, and that made\nme wretched; for I knew that it was impossible: and to see every one\nelse prejudiced in so deadly a manner, rendered me hopeless and\ndespairing.\u201d She wept.",
        "\u201cSweet niece,\u201d said my father, \u201cdry your tears.",
        "If she is, as you\nbelieve, innocent, rely on the justice of our judges, and the activity\nwith which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.",
        "We passed a few sad hours, until eleven o\u2019clock, when the trial was to\ncommence.",
        "My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend\nas witnesses, I accompanied them to the court.",
        "During the whole of this\nwretched mockery of justice, I suffered living torture.",
        "It was to be\ndecided, whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would\ncause the death of two of my fellow-beings: one a smiling babe, full of\ninnocence and joy; the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every\naggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.",
        "Justine also was a girl of merit, and possessed qualities which promised\nto render her life happy: now all was to be obliterated in an\nignominious grave; and I the cause!",
        "A thousand times rather would I have\nconfessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine; but I was\nabsent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been\nconsidered as the ravings of a madman, and would not have exculpated her\nwho suffered through me.",
        "The appearance of Justine was calm.",
        "She was dressed in mourning; and her\ncountenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her\nfeelings, exquisitely beautiful.",
        "Yet she appeared confident in\ninnocence, and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by\nthousands; for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\nexcited, was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the\nimagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.",
        "She was\ntranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her\nconfusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up\nher mind to an appearance of courage.",
        "When she entered the court, she\nthrew her eyes round it, and quickly discovered where we were seated.",
        "A\ntear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us; but she quickly recovered\nherself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter\nguiltlessness.",
        "The trial began; and after the advocate against her had stated the\ncharge, several witnesses were called.",
        "Several strange facts combined\nagainst her, which might have staggered any one who had not such proof\nof her innocence as I had.",
        "She had been out the whole of the night on\nwhich the murder had been committed, and towards morning had been\nperceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the\nmurdered child had been afterwards found.",
        "The woman asked her what she\ndid there; but she looked very strangely, and only returned a confused\nand unintelligible answer.",
        "She returned to the house about eight\no\u2019clock; and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\nreplied, that she had been looking for the child, and demanded\nearnestly, if any thing had been heard concerning him.",
        "When shewn the\nbody, she fell into violent hysterics, and kept her bed for several\ndays.",
        "The picture was then produced, which the servant had found in her\npocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the\nsame which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed\nround his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.",
        "Justine was called on for her defence.",
        "As the trial had proceeded, her\ncountenance had altered.",
        "Surprise, horror, and misery, were strongly\nexpressed.",
        "Sometimes she struggled with her tears; but when she was\ndesired to plead, she collected her powers, and spoke in an audible\nalthough variable voice:\u2014\n\n\u201cGod knows,\u201d she said, \u201chow entirely I am innocent.",
        "But I do not pretend\nthat my protestations should acquit me: I rest my innocence on a plain\nand simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me;\nand I hope the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a\nfavourable interpretation, where any circumstance appears doubtful or\nsuspicious.\u201d\n\nShe then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed\nthe evening of the night on which the murder had been committed, at the\nhouse of an aunt at Ch\u00eane, a village situated at about a league from\nGeneva.",
        "On her return, at about nine o\u2019clock, she met a man, who asked\nher if she had seen any thing of the child who was lost.",
        "She was alarmed\nby this account, and passed several hours in looking for him, when the\ngates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain several hours of\nthe night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being unwilling to call up\nthe inhabitants, to whom she was well known.",
        "Unable to rest or sleep,\nshe quitted her asylum early, that she might again endeavour to find my\nbrother.",
        "If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was\nwithout her knowledge.",
        "That she had been bewildered when questioned by\nthe market-woman, was not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless\nnight, and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.",
        "Concerning the\npicture she could give no account.",
        "\u201cI know,\u201d continued the unhappy victim, \u201chow heavily and fatally this\none circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining\nit; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to\nconjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been\nplaced in my pocket.",
        "But here also I am checked.",
        "I believe that I have\nno enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to\ndestroy me wantonly.",
        "Did the murderer place it there?",
        "I know of no\nopportunity afforded him for so doing; or if I had, why should he have\nstolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?",
        "\u201cI commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for\nhope.",
        "I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my\ncharacter; and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt,\nI must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my\ninnocence.\u201d\n\nSeveral witnesses were called, who had known her for many years, and\nthey spoke well of her; but fear, and hatred of the crime of which they\nsupposed her guilty, rendered them timorous, and unwilling to come\nforward.",
        "Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent\ndispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,\nwhen, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the\ncourt.",
        "\u201cI am,\u201d said she, \u201cthe cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, or\nrather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents\never since and even long before his birth.",
        "It may therefore be judged\nindecent in me to come forward on this occasion; but when I see a\nfellow-creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended\nfriends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I know of\nher character.",
        "I am well acquainted with the accused.",
        "I have lived in\nthe same house with her, at one time for five, and at another for nearly\ntwo years.",
        "During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable\nand benevolent of human creatures.",
        "She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my\naunt, in her last illness with the greatest affection and care; and\nafterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner\nthat excited the admiration of all who knew her.",
        "After which she again\nlived in my uncle\u2019s house, where she was beloved by all the family.",
        "She\nwas warmly attached to the child who is now dead, and acted towards him\nlike a most affectionate mother.",
        "For my own part, I do not hesitate to\nsay, that, notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I\nbelieve and rely on her perfect innocence.",
        "She had no temptation for\nsuch an action: as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she\nhad earnestly desired it, I should have willingly given it to her; so\nmuch do I esteem and value her.\u201d\n\nExcellent Elizabeth!",
        "A murmur of approbation was heard; but it was\nexcited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine,\non whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence,\ncharging her with the blackest ingratitude.",
        "She herself wept as\nElizabeth spoke, but she did not answer.",
        "My own agitation and anguish\nwas extreme during the whole trial.",
        "I believed in her innocence; I knew\nit.",
        "Could the d\u00e6mon, who had (I did not for a minute doubt) murdered my\nbrother, also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death\nand ignominy.",
        "I could not sustain the horror of my situation; and when I\nperceived that the popular voice, and the countenances of the judges,\nhad already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in\nagony.",
        "The tortures of the accused did not equal mine; she was sustained\nby innocence, but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom, and would not\nforego their hold.",
        "I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.",
        "In the morning I went to the\ncourt; my lips and throat were parched.",
        "I dared not ask the fatal\nquestion; but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my\nvisit.",
        "The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was\ncondemned.",
        "I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt.",
        "I had before experienced\nsensations of horror; and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them\nadequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the\nheart-sickening despair that I then endured.",
        "The person to whom I\naddressed myself added, that Justine had already confessed her guilt.",
        "\u201cThat evidence,\u201d he observed, \u201cwas hardly required in so glaring a case,\nbut I am glad of it; and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a\ncriminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive.\u201d\n\nWhen I returned home, Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.",
        "\u201cMy cousin,\u201d replied I, \u201cit is decided as you may have expected; all\njudges had rather that ten innocent should suffer, than that one guilty\nshould escape.",
        "But she has confessed.\u201d\n\nThis was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness\nupon Justine\u2019s innocence.",
        "\u201cAlas!\u201d said she, \u201chow shall I ever again\nbelieve in human benevolence?",
        "Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my\nsister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray;\nher mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or ill-humour, and yet\nshe has committed a murder.\u201d\n\nSoon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a wish to see my\ncousin.",
        "My father wished her not to go; but said, that he left it to her\nown judgment and feelings to decide.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cI will go,\nalthough she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me: I cannot go\nalone.\u201d The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not\nrefuse.",
        "We entered the gloomy prison-chamber, and beheld Justine sitting on some\nstraw at the further end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested\non her knees.",
        "She rose on seeing us enter; and when we were left alone\nwith her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly.",
        "My cousin wept also.",
        "\u201cOh, Justine!\u201d said she, \u201cwhy did you rob me of my last consolation.",
        "I\nrelied on your innocence; and although I was then very wretched, I was\nnot so miserable as I am now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked?",
        "Do you also\njoin with my enemies to crush me?\u201d Her voice was suffocated with sobs.",
        "\u201cRise, my poor girl,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cwhy do you kneel, if you are\ninnocent?",
        "I am not one of your enemies; I believed you guiltless,\nnotwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself\ndeclared your guilt.",
        "That report, you say, is false; and be assured,\ndear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment,\nbut your own confession.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did confess; but I confessed a lie.",
        "I confessed, that I might obtain\nabsolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my\nother sins.",
        "The God of heaven forgive me!",
        "Ever since I was condemned, my\nconfessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I almost\nbegan to think that I was the monster that he said I was.",
        "He threatened\nexcommunication and hell fire in my last moments, if I continued\nobdurate.",
        "Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked on me as a\nwretch doomed to ignominy and perdition.",
        "What could I do?",
        "In an evil\nhour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable.\u201d\n\nShe paused, weeping, and then continued\u2014\u201cI thought with horror, my\nsweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt\nhad so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable of a\ncrime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.",
        "Dear\nWilliam!",
        "dearest blessed child!",
        "I soon shall see you again in heaven,\nwhere we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I am to\nsuffer ignominy and death.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Justine!",
        "forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.",
        "Why\ndid you confess?",
        "But do not mourn, my dear girl; I will every where\nproclaim your innocence, and force belief.",
        "Yet you must die; you, my\nplayfellow, my companion, my more than sister.",
        "I never can survive so\nhorrible a misfortune.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear, sweet Elizabeth, do not weep.",
        "You ought to raise me with thoughts\nof a better life, and elevate me from the petty cares of this world of\ninjustice and strife.",
        "Do not you, excellent friend, drive me to\ndespair.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will try to comfort you; but this, I fear, is an evil too deep and\npoignant to admit of consolation, for there is no hope.",
        "Yet heaven\nbless thee, my dearest Justine, with resignation, and a confidence\nelevated beyond this world.",
        "Oh!",
        "how I hate its shews and mockeries!",
        "when\none creature is murdered, another is immediately deprived of life in a\nslow torturing manner; then the executioners, their hands yet reeking\nwith the blood of innocence, believe that they have done a great deed.",
        "They call this _retribution_.",
        "Hateful name!",
        "When that word is\npronounced, I know greater and more horrid punishments are going to be\ninflicted than the gloomiest tyrant has ever invented to satiate his\nutmost revenge.",
        "Yet this is not consolation for you, my Justine, unless\nindeed that you may glory in escaping from so miserable a den.",
        "Alas!",
        "I\nwould I were in peace with my aunt and my lovely William, escaped from a\nworld which is hateful to me, and the visages of men which I abhor.\u201d\n\nJustine smiled languidly.",
        "\u201cThis, dear lady, is despair, and not\nresignation.",
        "I must not learn the lesson that you would teach me.",
        "Talk\nof something else, something that will bring peace, and not increase of\nmisery.\u201d\n\nDuring this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison-room,\nwhere I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.",
        "Despair!",
        "Who\ndared talk of that?",
        "The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass the\ndreary boundary between life and death, felt not as I did, such deep and\nbitter agony.",
        "I gnashed my teeth, and ground them together, uttering a\ngroan that came from my inmost soul.",
        "Justine started.",
        "When she saw who\nit was, she approached me, and said, \u201cDear Sir, you are very kind to\nvisit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty.\u201d\n\nI could not answer.",
        "\u201cNo, Justine,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201che is more convinced\nof your innocence than I was; for even when he heard that you had\nconfessed, he did not credit it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI truly thank him.",
        "In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude\ntowards those who think of me with kindness.",
        "How sweet is the affection\nof others to such a wretch as I am!",
        "It removes more than half my\nmisfortune; and I feel as if I could die in peace, now that my innocence\nis acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.\u201d\n\nThus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.",
        "She indeed\ngained the resignation she desired.",
        "But I, the true murderer, felt the\nnever-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or\nconsolation.",
        "Elizabeth also wept, and was unhappy; but her\u2019s also was\nthe misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair\nmoon, for a while hides, but cannot tarnish its brightness.",
        "Anguish and\ndespair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within\nme, which nothing could extinguish.",
        "We staid several hours with Justine;\nand it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear herself away.",
        "\u201cI wish,\u201d cried she, \u201cthat I were to die with you; I cannot live in this\nworld of misery.\u201d\n\nJustine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty\nrepressed her bitter tears.",
        "She embraced Elizabeth, and said, in a voice\nof half-suppressed emotion, \u201cFarewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my\nbeloved and only friend; may heaven in its bounty bless and preserve\nyou; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer.",
        "Live,\nand be happy, and make others so.\u201d\n\nAs we returned, Elizabeth said, \u201cYou know not, my dear Victor, how much\nI am relieved, now that I trust in the innocence of this unfortunate\ngirl.",
        "I never could again have known peace, if I had been deceived in my\nreliance on her.",
        "For the moment that I did believe her guilty, I felt an\nanguish that I could not have long sustained.",
        "Now my heart is lightened.",
        "The innocent suffers; but she whom I thought amiable and good has not\nbetrayed the trust I reposed in her, and I am consoled.\u201d\n\nAmiable cousin!",
        "such were your thoughts, mild and gentle as your own\ndear eyes and voice.",

        "I\nhad begun life with benevolent intentions, and thirsted for the moment\nwhen I should put them in practice, and make myself useful to my\nfellow-beings.",
        "Now all was blasted: instead of that serenity of\nconscience, which allowed me to look back upon the past with\nself-satisfaction, and from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I\nwas seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to\na hell of intense tortures, such as no language can describe.",
        "This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had entirely recovered\nfrom the first shock it had sustained.",
        "I shunned the face of man; all\nsound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only\nconsolation\u2014deep, dark, death-like solitude.",
        "My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my\ndisposition and habits, and endeavoured to reason with me on the folly\nof giving way to immoderate grief.",
        "\u201cDo you think, Victor,\u201d said he,\n\u201cthat I do not suffer also?",
        "No one could love a child more than I loved\nyour brother;\u201d (tears came into his eyes as he spoke); \u201cbut is it not a\nduty to the survivors, that we should refrain from augmenting their\nunhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief?",
        "It is also a duty owed\nto yourself; for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or\neven the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for\nsociety.\u201d\n\nThis advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I\nshould have been the first to hide my grief, and console my friends, if\nremorse had not mingled its bitterness with my other sensations.",
        "Now I\ncould only answer my father with a look of despair, and endeavour to\nhide myself from his view.",
        "About this time we retired to our house at Belrive.",
        "This change was\nparticularly agreeable to me.",

        "Often, after the rest of the family had retired\nfor the night, I took the boat, and passed many hours upon the water.",
        "Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and sometimes,\nafter rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to pursue its\nown course, and gave way to my own miserable reflections.",
        "I was often\ntempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing\nthat wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly, if I except\nsome bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard\nonly when I approached the shore\u2014often, I say, I was tempted to plunge\ninto the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my\ncalamities for ever.",
        "But I was restrained, when I thought of the heroic\nand suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly loved, and whose existence was\nbound up in mine.",
        "I thought also of my father, and surviving brother:\nshould I by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the\nmalice of the fiend whom I had let loose among them?",
        "At these moments I wept bitterly, and wished that peace would revisit my\nmind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness.",

        "Our house was the house of mourning.",
        "My father\u2019s health was deeply\nshaken by the horror of the recent events.",
        "Elizabeth was sad and\ndesponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all\npleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears\nshe then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so\nblasted and destroyed.",
        "She was no longer that happy creature, who in\nearlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake, and talked with\necstacy of our future prospects.",

        "Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and\ninjustice, that I read in books or heard from others, as tales of\nancient days, or imaginary evils; at least they were remote, and more\nfamiliar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come\nhome, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other\u2019s blood.",
        "Yet I am certainly unjust.",
        "Every body believed that poor girl to be\nguilty; and if she could have committed the crime for which she\nsuffered, assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human\ncreatures.",
        "For the sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her\nbenefactor and friend, a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and\nappeared to love as if it had been her own!",

        "Yet she was innocent.",
        "I\nknow, I feel she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that\nconfirms me.",
        "Alas!",
        "Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth,\nwho can assure themselves of certain happiness?",
        "I feel as if I were\nwalking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are\ncrowding, and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.",
        "William and\nJustine were assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the\nworld free, and perhaps respected.",
        "But even if I were condemned to\nsuffer on the scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places\nwith such a wretch.\u201d\n\nI listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.",
        "I, not in deed,\nbut in effect, was the true murderer.",
        "Elizabeth read my anguish in my\ncountenance, and kindly taking my hand said, \u201cMy dearest cousin, you\nmust calm yourself.",
        "These events have affected me, God knows how deeply;\nbut I am not so wretched as you are.",
        "There is an expression of despair,\nand sometimes of revenge, in your countenance, that makes me tremble.",

        "We surely\nshall be happy: quiet in our native country, and not mingling in the\nworld, what can disturb our tranquillity?\u201d\n\nShe shed tears as she said this, distrusting the very solace that she\ngave; but at the same time she smiled, that she might chase away the\nfiend that lurked in my heart.",
        "My father, who saw in the unhappiness\nthat was painted in my face only an exaggeration of that sorrow which I\nmight naturally feel, thought that an amusement suited to my taste would\nbe the best means of restoring to me my wonted serenity.",
        "It was from\nthis cause that he had removed to the country; and, induced by the same\nmotive, he now proposed that we should all make an excursion to the\nvalley of Chamounix.",
        "I had been there before, but Elizabeth and Ernest\nnever had; and both had often expressed an earnest desire to see the\nscenery of this place, which had been described to them as so wonderful\nand sublime.",
        "Accordingly we departed from Geneva on this tour about the\nmiddle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of\nJustine.",
        "The weather was uncommonly fine; and if mine had been a sorrow to be\nchased away by any fleeting circumstance, this excursion would certainly\nhave had the effect intended by my father.",
        "As it was, I was somewhat\ninterested in the scene; it sometimes lulled, although it could not\nextinguish my grief.",
        "During the first day we travelled in a carriage.",
        "In\nthe morning we had seen the mountains at a distance, towards which we\ngradually advanced.",
        "We perceived that the valley through which we wound,\nand which was formed by the river Arve, whose course we followed, closed\nin upon us by degrees; and when the sun had set, we beheld immense\nmountains and precipices overhanging us on every side, and heard the\nsound of the river raging among rocks, and the dashing of water-falls\naround.",
        "The next day we pursued our journey upon mules; and as we ascended still\nhigher, the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.",
        "Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains; the\nimpetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from\namong the trees, formed a scene of singular beauty.",
        "But it was augmented\nand rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining\npyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the\nhabitations of another race of beings.",
        "We passed the bridge of Pelissier, where the ravine, which the river\nforms, opened before us, and we began to ascend the mountain that\noverhangs it.",
        "Soon after we entered the valley of Chamounix.",
        "This valley\nis more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as\nthat of Servox, through which we had just passed.",
        "The high and snowy\nmountains were its immediate boundaries; but we saw no more ruined\ncastles and fertile fields.",
        "Immense glaciers approached the road; we\nheard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche, and marked the\nsmoke of its passage.",
        "Mont Bl\u00e2nc, the supreme and magnificent Mont\nBl\u00e2nc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_, and its\ntremendous _dome_ overlooked the valley.",
        "During this journey, I sometimes joined Elizabeth, and exerted myself to\npoint out to her the various beauties of the scene.",
        "I often suffered my\nmule to lag behind, and indulged in the misery of reflection.",
        "At other\ntimes I spurred on the animal before my companions, that I might forget\nthem, the world, and, more than all, myself.",
        "When at a distance, I\nalighted, and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and\ndespair.",
        "At eight in the evening I arrived at Chamounix.",
        "My father and\nElizabeth were very much fatigued; Ernest, who accompanied us, was\ndelighted, and in high spirits: the only circumstance that detracted\nfrom his pleasure was the south wind, and the rain it seemed to promise\nfor the next day.",
        "We retired early to our apartments, but not to sleep; at least I did\nnot.",
        "I remained many hours at the window, watching the pallid lightning\nthat played above Mont Bl\u00e2nc, and listening to the rushing of the Arve,\nwhich ran below my window.",
        "CHAPTER II.",
        "The next day, contrary to the prognostications of our guides, was fine,\nalthough clouded.",
        "We visited the source of the Arveiron, and rode about\nthe valley until evening.",
        "These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded\nme the greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.",
        "They\nelevated me from all littleness of feeling; and although they did not\nremove my grief, they subdued and tranquillized it.",
        "In some degree,\nalso, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded\nfor the last month.",
        "I returned in the evening, fatigued, but less\nunhappy, and conversed with my family with more cheerfulness than had\nbeen my custom for some time.",
        "My father was pleased, and Elizabeth\noverjoyed.",
        "\u201cMy dear cousin,\u201d said she, \u201cyou see what happiness you\ndiffuse when you are happy; do not relapse again!\u201d\n\nThe following morning the rain poured down in torrents, and thick mists\nhid the summits of the mountains.",
        "I rose early, but felt unusually\nmelancholy.",
        "The rain depressed me; my old feelings recurred, and I was\nmiserable.",
        "I knew how disappointed my father would be at this sudden\nchange, and I wished to avoid him until I had recovered myself so far as\nto be enabled to conceal those feelings that overpowered me.",
        "I knew\nthat they would remain that day at the inn; and as I had ever inured\nmyself to rain, moisture, and cold, I resolved to go alone to the summit\nof Montanvert.",
        "I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous\nand ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.",
        "It had then filled me with a sublime ecstacy that gave wings to the\nsoul, and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.",
        "The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the\neffect of solemnizing my mind, and causing me to forget the passing\ncares of life.",
        "I determined to go alone, for I was well acquainted with\nthe path, and the presence of another would destroy the solitary\ngrandeur of the scene.",
        "The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\nwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the\nmountain.",
        "It is a scene terrifically desolate.",
        "In a thousand spots the\ntraces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken\nand strewed on the ground; some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning\nupon the jutting rocks of the mountain, or transversely upon other\ntrees.",
        "The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines of\nsnow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is\nparticularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking in\na loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\ndestruction upon the head of the speaker.",
        "The pines are not tall or\nluxuriant, but they are sombre, and add an air of severity to the scene.",
        "I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers\nwhich ran through it, and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite\nmountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain\npoured from the dark sky, and added to the melancholy impression I\nreceived from the objects around me.",
        "Alas!",
        "why does man boast of\nsensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders\nthem more necessary beings.",
        "If our impulses were confined to hunger,\nthirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by\nevery wind that blows, and a chance word or scene that that word may\nconvey to us.",
        "We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.",
        "We rise; one wand\u2019ring thought pollutes the day.",
        "We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh, or weep,\n      Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;\n    It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,\n      The path of its departure still is free.",
        "Man\u2019s yesterday may ne\u2019er be like his morrow;\n      Nought may endure but mutability!",
        "It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent.",
        "For some\ntime I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.",
        "A mist covered\nboth that and the surrounding mountains.",
        "Presently a breeze dissipated\nthe cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.",
        "The surface is very uneven,\nrising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and\ninterspersed by rifts that sink deep.",
        "The field of ice is almost a\nleague in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.",
        "The\nopposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.",
        "From the side where I\nnow stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;\nand above it rose Mont Bl\u00e2nc, in awful majesty.",
        "I remained in a recess\nof the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene.",
        "The sea, or\nrather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose\na\u00ebrial summits hung over its recesses.",
        "Their icy and glittering peaks\nshone in the sunlight over the clouds.",
        "My heart, which was before\nsorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed\u2014\u201cWandering\nspirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow\nme this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the\njoys of life.\u201d\n\nAs I said this, I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,\nadvancing towards me with superhuman speed.",
        "He bounded over the crevices\nin the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his stature also, as\nhe approached, seemed to exceed that of man.",
        "I was troubled: a mist came\nover my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me; but I was quickly\nrestored by the cold gale of the mountains.",
        "I perceived, as the shape\ncame nearer, (sight tremendous and abhorred!)",
        "that it was the wretch\nwhom I had created.",
        "I trembled with rage and horror, resolving to wait\nhis approach, and then close with him in mortal combat.",
        "He approached;\nhis countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and\nmalignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible\nfor human eyes.",
        "But I scarcely observed this; anger and hatred had at\nfirst deprived me of utterance, and I recovered only to overwhelm him\nwith words expressive of furious detestation and contempt.",
        "\u201cDevil!\u201d I exclaimed, \u201cdo you dare approach me?",
        "and do not you fear the\nfierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?",
        "Begone, vile\ninsect!",
        "or rather stay, that I may trample you to dust!",
        "and, oh, that I\ncould, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those\nvictims whom you have so diabolically murdered!\u201d\n\n\u201cI expected this reception,\u201d said the d\u00e6mon.",
        "\u201cAll men hate the wretched;\nhow then must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things!",
        "Yet\nyou, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art\nbound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us.",
        "You\npurpose to kill me.",
        "How dare you sport thus with life?",
        "Do your duty\ntowards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind.",
        "If\nyou will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace;\nbut if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated\nwith the blood of your remaining friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbhorred monster!",
        "fiend that thou art!",
        "the tortures of hell are too\nmild a vengeance for thy crimes.",
        "Wretched devil!",
        "you reproach me with\nyour creation; come on then, that I may extinguish the spark which I so\nnegligently bestowed.\u201d\n\nMy rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the\nfeelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.",
        "He easily eluded me, and said,\n\n\u201cBe calm!",
        "I entreat you to hear me, before you give vent to your hatred\non my devoted head.",
        "Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to\nincrease my misery?",
        "Life, although it may only be an accumulation of\nanguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.",
        "Remember, thou hast made\nme more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine; my joints\nmore supple.",
        "But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to\nthee.",
        "I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my\nnatural lord and king, if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which\nthou owest me.",
        "Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other, and\ntrample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and\naffection, is most due.",
        "Remember, that I am thy creature: I ought to be\nthy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy\nfor no misdeed.",
        "Every where I see bliss, from which I alone am\nirrevocably excluded.",
        "I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend.",
        "Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.\u201d\n\n\u201cBegone!",
        "I will not hear you.",
        "There can be no community between you and\nme; we are enemies.",
        "Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight, in\nwhich one must fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can I move thee?",
        "Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable\neye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion?",
        "Believe\nme, Frankenstein: I was benevolent; my soul glowed with love and\nhumanity: but am I not alone, miserably alone?",
        "You, my creator, abhor\nme; what hope can I gather from your fellow-creatures, who owe me\nnothing?",
        "they spurn and hate me.",
        "The desert mountains and dreary\nglaciers are my refuge.",
        "I have wandered here many days; the caves of\nice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one\nwhich man does not grudge.",
        "These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder\nto me than your fellow-beings.",
        "If the multitude of mankind knew of my\nexistence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for my\ndestruction.",
        "Shall I not then hate them who abhor me?",
        "I will keep no\nterms with my enemies.",
        "I am miserable, and they shall share my\nwretchedness.",
        "Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them\nfrom an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not\nonly you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed\nup in the whirlwinds of its rage.",
        "Let your compassion be moved, and do\nnot disdain me.",
        "Listen to my tale: when you have heard that, abandon or\ncommiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.",
        "But hear me.",
        "The\nguilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they may be, to speak in\ntheir own defence before they are condemned.",
        "Listen to me, Frankenstein.",
        "You accuse me of murder; and yet you would, with a satisfied conscience,\ndestroy your own creature.",
        "Oh, praise the eternal justice of man!",
        "Yet I\nask you not to spare me: listen to me; and then, if you can, and if you\nwill, destroy the work of your hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you call to my remembrance circumstances of which I shudder to\nreflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author?",
        "Cursed be the\nday, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light!",
        "Cursed (although I\ncurse myself) be the hands that formed you!",
        "You have made me wretched\nbeyond expression.",
        "You have left me no power to consider whether I am\njust to you, or not.",
        "Begone!",
        "relieve me from the sight of your detested\nform.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus I relieve thee, my creator,\u201d he said, and placed his hated hands\nbefore my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; \u201cthus I take from\nthee a sight which you abhor.",
        "Still thou canst listen to me, and grant\nme thy compassion.",
        "By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this\nfrom you.",
        "Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of\nthis place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon\nthe mountain.",
        "The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to\nhide itself behind yon snowy precipices, and illuminate another world,\nyou will have heard my story, and can decide.",
        "On you it rests, whether I\nquit for ever the neighbourhood of man, and lead a harmless life, or\nbecome the scourge of your fellow-creatures, and the author of your own\nspeedy ruin.\u201d\n\nAs he said this, he led the way across the ice: I followed.",
        "My heart was\nfull, and I did not answer him; but, as I proceeded, I weighed the\nvarious arguments that he had used, and determined at least to listen to\nhis tale.",
        "I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my\nresolution.",
        "I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my\nbrother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.",
        "For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards\nhis creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I\ncomplained of his wickedness.",
        "These motives urged me to comply with his\ndemand.",
        "We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock.",
        "The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend: we entered the\nhut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart, and\ndepressed spirits.",
        "But I consented to listen; and, seating myself by the\nfire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.",
        "CHAPTER III.",
        "\u201cIt is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original \u00e6ra of\nmy being: all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.",
        "A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,\nand smelt, at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I\nlearned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses.",
        "By\ndegrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I\nwas obliged to shut my eyes.",
        "Darkness then came over me, and troubled\nme; but hardly had I felt this, when, by opening my eyes, as I now\nsuppose, the light poured in upon me again.",
        "I walked, and, I believe,\ndescended; but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.",
        "Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch\nor sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no\nobstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid.",
        "The light became\nmore and more oppressive to me; and, the heat wearying me as I walked, I\nsought a place where I could receive shade.",
        "This was the forest near\nIngolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my\nfatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst.",
        "This roused me\nfrom my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found\nhanging on the trees, or lying on the ground.",
        "I slaked my thirst at the\nbrook; and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.",
        "\u201cIt was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half-frightened as it\nwere instinctively, finding myself so desolate.",
        "Before I had quitted\nyour apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some\nclothes; but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of\nnight.",
        "I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could\ndistinguish, nothing; but, feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat\ndown and wept.",
        "\u201cSoon a gentle light stole over the heavens, and gave me a sensation of\npleasure.",
        "I started up, and beheld a radiant form rise from among the\ntrees.",
        "I gazed with a kind of wonder.",
        "It moved slowly, but it\nenlightened my path; and I again went out in search of berries.",
        "I was\nstill cold, when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which\nI covered myself, and sat down upon the ground.",
        "No distinct ideas\noccupied my mind; all was confused.",
        "I felt light, and hunger, and\nthirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rung in my ears, and on all\nsides various scents saluted me: the only object that I could\ndistinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with\npleasure.",
        "\u201cSeveral changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had\ngreatly lessened when I began to distinguish my sensations from each\nother.",
        "I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with\ndrink, and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.",
        "I was delighted\nwhen I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my\nears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had\noften intercepted the light from my eyes.",
        "I began also to observe, with\ngreater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me, and to perceive the\nboundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me.",
        "Sometimes I\ntried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds, but was unable.",
        "Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the\nuncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into\nsilence again.",
        "\u201cThe moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened\nform, shewed itself, while I still remained in the forest.",
        "My sensations\nhad, by this time, become distinct, and my mind received every day\nadditional ideas.",
        "My eyes became accustomed to the light, and to\nperceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from\nthe herb, and, by degrees, one herb from another.",
        "I found that the\nsparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and\nthrush were sweet and enticing.",
        "\u201cOne day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been\nleft by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the\nwarmth I experienced from it.",
        "In my joy I thrust my hand into the live\nembers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain.",
        "How strange, I\nthought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects!",
        "I\nexamined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be\ncomposed of wood.",
        "I quickly collected some branches; but they were wet,\nand would not burn.",
        "I was pained at this, and sat still watching the\noperation of the fire.",
        "The wet wood which I had placed near the heat\ndried, and itself became inflamed.",
        "I reflected on this; and, by touching\nthe various branches, I discovered the cause, and busied myself in\ncollecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it, and have a\nplentiful supply of fire.",
        "When night came on, and brought sleep with it,\nI was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.",
        "I\ncovered it carefully with dry wood and leaves, and placed wet branches\nupon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground, and sunk\ninto sleep.",
        "\u201cIt was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.",
        "I\nuncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.",
        "I\nobserved this also, and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the\nembers when they were nearly extinguished.",
        "When night came again, I\nfound, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat; and that\nthe discovery of this element was useful to me in my food; for I found\nsome of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and\ntasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees.",
        "I\ntried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the\nlive embers.",
        "I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation,\nand the nuts and roots much improved.",
        "\u201cFood, however, became scarce; and I often spent the whole day searching\nin vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger.",
        "When I found\nthis, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to\nseek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily\nsatisfied.",
        "In this emigration, I exceedingly lamented the loss of the\nfire which I had obtained through accident, and knew not how to\nre-produce it.",
        "I gave several hours to the serious consideration of\nthis difficulty; but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply\nit; and, wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood\ntowards the setting sun.",
        "I passed three days in these rambles, and at\nlength discovered the open country.",
        "A great fall of snow had taken place\nthe night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the\nappearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold\ndamp substance that covered the ground.",
        "\u201cIt was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and\nshelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which\nhad doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.",
        "This was\na new sight to me; and I examined the structure with great curiosity.",
        "Finding the door open, I entered.",
        "An old man sat in it, near a fire,\nover which he was preparing his breakfast.",
        "He turned on hearing a noise;\nand, perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and, quitting the hut, ran across\nthe fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared\ncapable.",
        "His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and\nhis flight, somewhat surprised me.",
        "But I was enchanted by the appearance\nof the hut: here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was\ndry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as\nPand\u00e6monium appeared to the d\u00e6mons of hell after their sufferings in the\nlake of fire.",
        "I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd\u2019s\nbreakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the\nlatter, however, I did not like.",
        "Then overcome by fatigue, I lay down\namong some straw, and fell asleep.",
        "\u201cIt was noon when I awoke; and, allured by the warmth of the sun, which\nshone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my\ntravels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant\u2019s breakfast in a\nwallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until\nat sunset I arrived at a village.",
        "How miraculous did this appear!",
        "the\nhuts, the neater cottages, and stately houses, engaged my admiration by\nturns.",
        "The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw\nplaced at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite.",
        "One\nof the best of these I entered; but I had hardly placed my foot within\nthe door, before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.",
        "The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,\ngrievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I\nescaped to the open country, and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,\nquite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had\nbeheld in the village.",
        "This hovel, however, joined a cottage of a neat\nand pleasant appearance; but, after my late dearly-bought experience, I\ndared not enter it.",
        "My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so\nlow, that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.",
        "No wood, however,\nwas placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and\nalthough the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an\nagreeable asylum from the snow and rain.",
        "\u201cHere then I retreated, and lay down, happy to have found a shelter,\nhowever miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more\nfrom the barbarity of man.",
        "\u201cAs soon as morning dawned, I crept from my kennel, that I might view\nthe adjacent cottage, and discover if I could remain in the habitation I\nhad found.",
        "It was situated against the back of the cottage, and\nsurrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig-stye and a clear\npool of water.",
        "One part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I\ncovered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and\nwood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass\nout: all the light I enjoyed came through the stye, and that was\nsufficient for me.",
        "\u201cHaving thus arranged my dwelling, and carpeted it with clean straw, I\nretired; for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered\ntoo well my treatment the night before, to trust myself in his power.",
        "I\nhad first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day, by a loaf\nof coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink,\nmore conveniently than from my hand, of the pure water which flowed by\nmy retreat.",
        "The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly\ndry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably\nwarm.",
        "\u201cBeing thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel, until\nsomething should occur which might alter my determination.",
        "It was indeed\na paradise, compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the\nrain-dropping branches, and dank earth.",
        "I ate my breakfast with\npleasure, and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little\nwater, when I heard a step, and, looking through a small chink, I beheld\na young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel.",
        "The\ngirl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found\ncottagers and farm-house servants to be.",
        "Yet she was meanly dressed, a\ncoarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair\nhair was plaited, but not adorned; she looked patient, yet sad.",
        "I lost\nsight of her; and in about a quarter of an hour she returned, bearing\nthe pail, which was now partly filled with milk.",
        "As she walked along,\nseemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose\ncountenance expressed a deeper despondence.",
        "Uttering a few sounds with\nan air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head, and bore it to the\ncottage himself.",
        "She followed, and they disappeared.",
        "Presently I saw the\nyoung man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the\ncottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house, and\nsometimes in the yard.",
        "\u201cOn examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the\ncottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been\nfilled up with wood.",
        "In one of these was a small and almost\nimperceptible chink, through which the eye could just penetrate.",
        "Through\nthis crevice, a small room was visible, white-washed and clean, but very\nbare of furniture.",
        "In one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man,\nleaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude.",
        "The young girl\nwas occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something\nout of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the\nold man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play, and to produce\nsounds, sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale.",
        "It was\na lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch!",
        "who had never beheld aught\nbeautiful before.",
        "The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged\ncottager, won my reverence; while the gentle manners of the girl enticed\nmy love.",
        "He played a sweet mournful air, which I perceived drew tears\nfrom the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no\nnotice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and\nthe fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet.",
        "He raised her,\nand smiled with such kindness and affection, that I felt sensations of a\npeculiar and over-powering nature: they were a mixture of pain and\npleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or\ncold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear\nthese emotions.",
        "\u201cSoon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load\nof wood.",
        "The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his\nburden, and, taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the\nfire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and\nhe shewed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.",
        "She seemed pleased;\nand went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in\nwater, and then upon the fire.",
        "She afterwards continued her work, whilst\nthe young man went into the garden, and appeared busily employed in\ndigging and pulling up roots.",
        "After he had been employed thus about an\nhour, the young woman joined him, and they entered the cottage together.",
        "\u201cThe old man had, in the mean time, been pensive; but, on the appearance\nof his companions, he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to\neat.",
        "The meal was quickly dispatched.",
        "The young woman was again occupied\nin arranging the cottage; the old man walked before the cottage in the\nsun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.",
        "Nothing could\nexceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures.",
        "One\nwas old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence\nand love: the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his\nfeatures were moulded with the finest symmetry; yet his eyes and\nattitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.",
        "The old man\nreturned to the cottage; and the youth, with tools different from those\nhe had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.",
        "\u201cNight quickly shut in; but, to my extreme wonder, I found that the\ncottagers had a means of prolonging light, by the use of tapers, and was\ndelighted to find, that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the\npleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours.",
        "In the evening,\nthe young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations\nwhich I did not understand; and the old man again took up the\ninstrument, which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in\nthe morning.",
        "So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,\nbut to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the\nharmony of the old man\u2019s instrument or the songs of the birds; I since\nfound that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science\nof words or letters.",
        "\u201cThe family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,\nextinguished their lights, and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.",
        "\u201cI lay on my straw, but I could not sleep.",
        "I thought of the occurrences\nof the day.",
        "What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these\npeople; and I longed to join them, but dared not.",
        "I remembered too well\nthe treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous\nvillagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter\nthink it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in\nmy hovel, watching, and endeavouring to discover the motives which\ninfluenced their actions.",
        "\u201cThe cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.",
        "The young woman\narranged the cottage, and prepared the food; and the youth departed\nafter the first meal.",
        "\u201cThis day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.",
        "The\nyoung man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various\nlaborious occupations within.",
        "The old man, whom I soon perceived to be\nblind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument, or in\ncontemplation.",
        "Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the\nyounger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion.",
        "They\nperformed towards him every little office of affection and duty with\ngentleness; and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.",
        "\u201cThey were not entirely happy.",
        "The young man and his companion often\nwent apart, and appeared to weep.",
        "I saw no cause for their unhappiness;\nbut I was deeply affected by it.",
        "If such lovely creatures were\nmiserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,\nshould be wretched.",
        "Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?",
        "They\npossessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes), and every\nluxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill, and delicious viands\nwhen hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,\nthey enjoyed one another\u2019s company and speech, interchanging each day\nlooks of affection and kindness.",
        "What did their tears imply?",
        "Did they\nreally express pain?",
        "I was at first unable to solve these questions; but\nperpetual attention, and time, explained to me many appearances which\nwere at first enigmatic.",
        "\u201cA considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of\nthe uneasiness of this amiable family; it was poverty: and they suffered\nthat evil in a very distressing degree.",
        "Their nourishment consisted\nentirely of the vegetables of their garden, and the milk of one cow, who\ngave very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely\nprocure food to support it.",
        "They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of\nhunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers; for\nseveral times they placed food before the old man, when they reserved\nnone for themselves.",
        "\u201cThis trait of kindness moved me sensibly.",
        "I had been accustomed,\nduring the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption;\nbut when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I\nabstained, and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots, which I\ngathered from a neighbouring wood.",
        "\u201cI discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist\ntheir labours.",
        "I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in\ncollecting wood for the family fire; and, during the night, I often took\nhis tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home\nfiring sufficient for the consumption of several days.",
        "\u201cI remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she\nopened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a\ngreat pile of wood on the outside.",
        "She uttered some words in a loud\nvoice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise.",
        "I\nobserved, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but\nspent it in repairing the cottage, and cultivating the garden.",
        "\u201cBy degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment.",
        "I found that\nthese people possessed a method of communicating their experience and\nfeelings to one another by articulate sounds.",
        "I perceived that the words\nthey spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in\nthe minds and countenances of the hearers.",
        "This was indeed a godlike\nscience, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it.",
        "But I was\nbaffled in every attempt I made for this purpose.",
        "Their pronunciation\nwas quick; and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connexion\nwith visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could\nunravel the mystery of their reference.",
        "By great application, however,\nand after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the\nmoon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the\nmost familiar objects of discourse: I learned and applied the words\n_fire_, _milk_, _bread_, and _wood_.",
        "I learned also the names of the\ncottagers themselves.",
        "The youth and his companion had each of them\nseveral names, but the old man had only one, which was _father_.",
        "The\ngirl was called _sister_, or _Agatha_; and the youth _Felix_, _brother_,\nor _son_.",
        "I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas\nappropriated to each of these sounds, and was able to pronounce them.",
        "I\ndistinguished several other words, without being able as yet to\nunderstand or apply them; such as _good_, _dearest_, _unhappy_.",
        "\u201cI spent the winter in this manner.",
        "The gentle manners and beauty of the\ncottagers greatly endeared them to me: when they were unhappy, I felt\ndepressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys.",
        "I saw few\nhuman beings beside them; and if any other happened to enter the\ncottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the\nsuperior accomplishments of my friends.",
        "The old man, I could perceive,\noften endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that\nhe called them, to cast off their melancholy.",
        "He would talk in a\ncheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure\neven upon me.",
        "Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled\nwith tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I\ngenerally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\nhaving listened to the exhortations of her father.",
        "It was not thus with\nFelix.",
        "He was always the saddest of the groupe; and, even to my\nunpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his\nfriends.",
        "But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more\ncheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old\nman.",
        "\u201cI could mention innumerable instances, which, although slight, marked\nthe dispositions of these amiable cottagers.",
        "In the midst of poverty and\nwant, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white\nflower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground.",
        "Early in the\nmorning before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed\nher path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the\nwood from the out-house, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found\nhis store always replenished by an invisible hand.",
        "In the day, I\nbelieve, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often\nwent forth, and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with\nhim.",
        "At other times he worked in the garden; but, as there was little to\ndo in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha.",
        "\u201cThis reading had puzzled me extremely at first; but, by degrees, I\ndiscovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when\nhe talked.",
        "I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs\nfor speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend\nthese also; but how was that possible, when I did not even understand\nthe sounds for which they stood as signs?",
        "I improved, however, sensibly\nin this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of\nconversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour: for I\neasily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to\nthe cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become\nmaster of their language; which knowledge might enable me to make them\noverlook the deformity of my figure; for with this also the contrast\nperpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.",
        "\u201cI had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers\u2014their grace, beauty,\nand delicate complexions: but how was I terrified, when I viewed myself\nin a transparent pool!",
        "At first I started back, unable to believe that\nit was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully\nconvinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with\nthe bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.",
        "Alas!",
        "I did\nnot yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.",
        "\u201cAs the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer, the snow\nvanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.",
        "From this\ntime Felix was more employed; and the heart-moving indications of\nimpending famine disappeared.",
        "Their food, as I afterwards found, was\ncoarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.",
        "Several new kinds of plants sprung up in the garden, which they dressed;\nand these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.",
        "\u201cThe old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did\nnot rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its\nwaters.",
        "This frequently took place; but a high wind quickly dried the\nearth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.",
        "\u201cMy mode of life in my hovel was uniform.",
        "During the morning I attended\nthe motions of the cottagers; and when they were dispersed in various\noccupations, I slept: the remainder of the day was spent in observing my\nfriends.",
        "When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon, or the\nnight was star-light, I went into the woods, and collected my own food\nand fuel for the cottage.",
        "When I returned, as often as it was necessary,\nI cleared their path from the snow, and performed those offices that I\nhad seen done by Felix.",
        "I afterwards found that these labours, performed\nby an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard\nthem, on these occasions, utter the words _good spirit_, _wonderful_;\nbut I did not then understand the signification of these terms.",
        "\u201cMy thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the\nmotives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to\nknow why Felix appeared so miserable, and Agatha so sad.",
        "I thought\n(foolish wretch!)",
        "that it might be in my power to restore happiness to\nthese deserving people.",
        "When I slept, or was absent, the forms of the\nvenerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix,\nflitted before me.",
        "I looked upon them as superior beings, who would be\nthe arbiters of my future destiny.",
        "I formed in my imagination a thousand\npictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me.",
        "I\nimagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and\nconciliating words, I should first win their favour, and afterwards\ntheir love.",
        "\u201cThese thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to apply with fresh ardour to\nthe acquiring the art of language.",
        "My organs were indeed harsh, but\nsupple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their\ntones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.",
        "It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass, whose\nintentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved\nbetter treatment than blows and execration.",
        "\u201cThe pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the\naspect of the earth.",
        "Men, who before this change seemed to have been hid\nin caves, dispersed themselves, and were employed in various arts of\ncultivation.",
        "The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves\nbegan to bud forth on the trees.",
        "Happy, happy earth!",
        "fit habitation for\ngods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome.",
        "My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the\npast was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the\nfuture gilded by bright rays of hope, and anticipations of joy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.",
        "\u201cI now hasten to the more moving part of my story.",
        "I shall relate events\nthat impressed me with feelings which, from what I was, have made me\nwhat I am.",
        "\u201cSpring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine, and the skies\ncloudless.",
        "It surprised me, that what before was desert and gloomy\nshould now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure.",
        "My senses\nwere gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight, and a\nthousand sights of beauty.",
        "\u201cIt was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from\nlabour\u2014the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to\nhim\u2014I observed that the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond\nexpression: he sighed frequently; and once his father paused in his\nmusic, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his\nson\u2019s sorrow.",
        "Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was\nrecommencing his music, when some one tapped at the door.",
        "\u201cIt was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a countryman as a guide.",
        "The\nlady was dressed in a dark suit, and covered with a thick black veil.",
        "Agatha asked a question; to which the stranger only replied by\npronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.",
        "Her voice was\nmusical, but unlike that of either of my friends.",
        "On hearing this word,\nFelix came up hastily to the lady; who, when she saw him, threw up her\nveil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.",
        "Her\nhair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were\ndark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular\nproportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a\nlovely pink.",
        "\u201cFelix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of\nsorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of\necstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes\nsparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I\nthought him as beautiful as the stranger.",
        "She appeared affected by\ndifferent feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held\nout her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously, and called her, as\nwell as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.",
        "She did not appear to\nunderstand him, but smiled.",
        "He assisted her to dismount, and, dismissing\nher guide, conducted her into the cottage.",
        "Some conversation took place\nbetween him and his father; and the young stranger knelt at the old\nman\u2019s feet, and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her, and\nembraced her affectionately.",
        "\u201cI soon perceived, that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds,\nand appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood\nby, or herself understood, the cottagers.",
        "They made many signs which I\ndid not comprehend; but I saw that her presence diffused gladness\nthrough the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the\nmorning mists.",
        "Felix seemed peculiarly happy, and with smiles of delight\nwelcomed his Arabian.",
        "Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed the hands\nof the lovely stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made signs which\nappeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came.",
        "Some\nhours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the\ncause of which I did not comprehend.",
        "Presently I found, by the frequent\nrecurrence of one sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she\nwas endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly\noccurred to me, that I should make use of the same instructions to the\nsame end.",
        "The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson,\nmost of them indeed were those which I had before understood, but I\nprofited by the others.",
        "\u201cAs night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early.",
        "When they\nseparated, Felix kissed the hand of the stranger, and said, \u2018Good night,\nsweet Safie.\u2019 He sat up much longer, conversing with his father; and, by\nthe frequent repetition of her name, I conjectured that their lovely\nguest was the subject of their conversation.",
        "I ardently desired to\nunderstand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found\nit utterly impossible.",
        "\u201cThe next morning Felix went out to his work; and, after the usual\noccupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the\nold man, and, taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly\nbeautiful, that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my\neyes.",
        "She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or\ndying away, like a nightingale of the woods.",
        "\u201cWhen she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first\ndeclined it.",
        "She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in\nsweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.",
        "The old\nman appeared enraptured, and said some words, which Agatha endeavoured\nto explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that\nshe bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.",
        "\u201cThe days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration,\nthat joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.",
        "Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the\nknowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most\nof the words uttered by my protectors.",
        "\u201cIn the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and\nthe green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the\nscent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;\nthe sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal\nrambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably\nshortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun; for I never\nventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same\ntreatment as I had formerly endured in the first village which I\nentered.",
        "\u201cMy days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily\nmaster the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than\nthe Arabian, who understood very little, and conversed in broken\naccents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that\nwas spoken.",
        "\u201cWhile I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters, as it\nwas taught to the stranger; and this opened before me a wide field for\nwonder and delight.",
        "\u201cThe book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney\u2019s _Ruins of\nEmpires_.",
        "I should not have understood the purport of this book, had not\nFelix, in reading it, given very minute explanations.",
        "He had chosen this\nwork, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of\nthe eastern authors.",
        "Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of\nhistory, and a view of the several empires at present existing in the\nworld; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and\nreligions of the different nations of the earth.",
        "I heard of the slothful\nAsiatics; of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians;\nof the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans\u2014of their\nsubsequent degeneration\u2014of the decline of that mighty empire; of\nchivalry, Christianity, and kings.",
        "I heard of the discovery of the\nAmerican hemisphere, and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its\noriginal inhabitants.",
        "\u201cThese wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings.",
        "Was man,\nindeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so\nvicious and base?",
        "He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil\nprinciple, and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and\ngodlike.",
        "To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that\ncan befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record\nhave been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than\nthat of the blind mole or harmless worm.",
        "For a long time I could not\nconceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why\nthere were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and\nbloodshed, my wonder ceased, and I turned away with disgust and\nloathing.",
        "\u201cEvery conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.",
        "While\nI listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian,\nthe strange system of human society was explained to me.",
        "I heard of the\ndivision of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty; of rank,\ndescent, and noble blood.",
        "\u201cThe words induced me to turn towards myself.",
        "I learned that the\npossessions most esteemed by your fellow-creatures were, high and\nunsullied descent united with riches.",
        "A man might be respected with only\none of these acquisitions; but without either he was considered, except\nin very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his\npowers for the profit of the chosen few.",
        "And what was I?",
        "Of my creation\nand creator I was absolutely ignorant; but I knew that I possessed no\nmoney, no friends, no kind of property.",
        "I was, besides, endowed with a\nfigure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same\nnature as man.",
        "I was more agile than they, and could subsist upon\ncoarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to\nmy frame; my stature far exceeded their\u2019s.",
        "When I looked around, I saw\nand heard of none like me.",
        "Was I then a monster, a blot upon the earth,\nfrom which all men fled, and whom all men disowned?",
        "\u201cI cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted\nupon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with\nknowledge.",
        "Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known\nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!",
        "\u201cOf what a strange nature is knowledge!",
        "It clings to the mind, when it\nhas once seized on it, like a lichen on the rock.",
        "I wished sometimes to\nshake off all thought and feeling; but I learned that there was but one\nmeans to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death\u2014a state\nwhich I feared yet did not understand.",
        "I admired virtue and good\nfeelings, and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my\ncottagers; but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through\nmeans which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and\nwhich rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one\namong my fellows.",
        "The gentle words of Agatha, and the animated smiles of\nthe charming Arabian, were not for me.",
        "The mild exhortations of the old\nman, and the lively conversation of the loved Felix, were not for me.",
        "Miserable, unhappy wretch!",
        "\u201cOther lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.",
        "I heard of the\ndifference of sexes; of the birth and growth of children; how the father\ndoated on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older\nchild; how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapt up in the\nprecious charge; how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge; of\nbrother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human\nbeing to another in mutual bonds.",
        "\u201cBut where were my friends and relations?",
        "No father had watched my\ninfant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if\nthey had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I\ndistinguished nothing.",
        "From my earliest remembrance I had been as I then\nwas in height and proportion.",
        "I had never yet seen a being resembling\nme, or who claimed any intercourse with me.",
        "What was I?",
        "The question\nagain recurred, to be answered only with groans.",
        "\u201cI will soon explain to what these feelings tended; but allow me now to\nreturn to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings\nof indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in\nadditional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an\ninnocent, half painful self-deceit, to call them).\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.",
        "\u201cSome time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends.",
        "It was\none which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding\nas it did a number of circumstances each interesting and wonderful to\none so utterly inexperienced as I was.",
        "\u201cThe name of the old man was De Lacey.",
        "He was descended from a good\nfamily in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,\nrespected by his superiors, and beloved by his equals.",
        "His son was bred\nin the service of his country; and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the\nhighest distinction.",
        "A few months before my arrival, they had lived in a\nlarge and luxurious city, called Paris, surrounded by friends, and\npossessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or\ntaste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.",
        "\u201cThe father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin.",
        "He was a Turkish\nmerchant, and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some reason\nwhich I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.",
        "He was\nseized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from\nConstantinople to join him.",
        "He was tried, and condemned to death.",
        "The\ninjustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;\nand it was judged that his religion and wealth, rather than the crime\nalleged against him, had been the cause of his condemnation.",
        "\u201cFelix had been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were\nuncontrollable, when he heard the decision of the court.",
        "He made, at\nthat moment, a solemn vow to deliver him, and then looked around for the\nmeans.",
        "After many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison,\nhe found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building,\nwhich lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate Mahometan; who, loaded with\nchains, waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence.",
        "Felix\nvisited the grate at night, and made known to the prisoner his\nintentions in his favour.",
        "The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to\nkindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth.",
        "Felix\nrejected his offers with contempt; yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who\nwas allowed to visit her father, and who, by her gestures, expressed her\nlively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind, that\nthe captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and\nhazard.",
        "\u201cThe Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on\nthe heart of Felix, and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his\ninterests by the promise of her hand in marriage, so soon as he should\nbe conveyed to a place of safety.",
        "Felix was too delicate to accept this\noffer; yet he looked forward to the probability of that event as to the\nconsummation of his happiness.",
        "\u201cDuring the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for\nthe escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several\nletters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to\nexpress her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old\nman, a servant of her father\u2019s, who understood French.",
        "She thanked him\nin the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her father;\nand at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.",
        "\u201cI have copies of these letters; for I found means, during my residence\nin the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were\noften in the hands of Felix or Agatha.",
        "Before I depart, I will give them\nto you, they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present, as the\nsun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat the\nsubstance of them to you.",
        "\u201cSafie related, that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a\nslave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of\nthe father of Safie, who married her.",
        "The young girl spoke in high and\nenthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom spurned the\nbondage to which she was now reduced.",
        "She instructed her daughter in the\ntenets of her religion, and taught her to aspire to higher powers of\nintellect, and an independence of spirit, forbidden to the female\nfollowers of Mahomet.",
        "This lady died; but her lessons were indelibly\nimpressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again\nreturning to Asia, and the being immured within the walls of a harem,\nallowed only to occupy herself with puerile amusements, ill suited to\nthe temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble\nemulation for virtue.",
        "The prospect of marrying a Christian, and\nremaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in\nsociety, was enchanting to her.",
        "\u201cThe day for the execution of the Turk was fixed; but, on the night\nprevious to it, he had quitted prison, and before morning was distant\nmany leagues from Paris.",
        "Felix had procured passports in the name of his\nfather, sister, and himself.",
        "He had previously communicated his plan to\nthe former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under the\npretence of a journey, and concealed himself, with his daughter, in an\nobscure part of Paris.",
        "\u201cFelix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons, and across Mont\nCenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable\nopportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.",
        "\u201cSafie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his\ndeparture, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she\nshould be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in\nexpectation of that event; and in the mean time he enjoyed the society\nof the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest\naffection.",
        "They conversed with one another through the means of an\ninterpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie\nsang to him the divine airs of her native country.",
        "\u201cThe Turk allowed this intimacy to take place, and encouraged the hopes\nof the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other\nplans.",
        "He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a\nChristian; but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear\nlukewarm; for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer,\nif he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they\ninhabited.",
        "He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to\nprolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and secretly\nto take his daughter with him when he departed.",
        "His plans were greatly\nfacilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.",
        "\u201cThe government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their\nvictim, and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer.",
        "The plot\nof Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were thrown\ninto prison.",
        "The news reached Felix, and roused him from his dream of\npleasure.",
        "His blind and aged father, and his gentle sister, lay in a\nnoisome dungeon, while he enjoyed the free air, and the society of her\nwhom he loved.",
        "This idea was torture to him.",
        "He quickly arranged with\nthe Turk, that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for\nescape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a\nboarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,\nhe hastened to Paris, and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the\nlaw, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.",
        "\u201cHe did not succeed.",
        "They remained confined for five months before the\ntrial took place; the result of which deprived them of their fortune,\nand condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.",
        "\u201cThey found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I\ndiscovered them.",
        "Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom\nhe and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on discovering\nthat his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and impotence, became a\ntraitor to good feeling and honour, and had quitted Italy with his\ndaughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as\nhe said, in some plan of future maintenance.",
        "\u201cSuch were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix, and rendered\nhim, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family.",
        "He could\nhave endured poverty, and when this distress had been the meed of his\nvirtue, he would have gloried in it: but the ingratitude of the Turk,\nand the loss of his beloved Safie, were misfortunes more bitter and\nirreparable.",
        "The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his\nsoul.",
        "\u201cWhen the news reached Leghorn, that Felix was deprived of his wealth\nand rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her\nlover, but to prepare to return with him to her native country.",
        "The\ngenerous nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to\nexpostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his\ntyrannical mandate.",
        "\u201cA few days after, the Turk entered his daughter\u2019s apartment, and told\nher hastily, that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn\nhad been divulged, and that he should speedily be delivered up to the\nFrench government; he had, consequently, hired a vessel to convey him\nto Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours.",
        "He\nintended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant,\nto follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property, which\nhad not yet arrived at Leghorn.",
        "\u201cWhen alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it\nwould become her to pursue in this emergency.",
        "A residence in Turkey was\nabhorrent to her; her religion and feelings were alike adverse to it.",
        "By\nsome papers of her father\u2019s, which fell into her hands, she heard of the\nexile of her lover, and learnt the name of the spot where he then\nresided.",
        "She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her\ndetermination.",
        "Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her, and a\nsmall sum of money, she quitted Italy, with an attendant, a native of\nLeghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed\nfor Germany.",
        "\u201cShe arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage\nof De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill.",
        "Safie nursed her\nwith the most devoted affection; but the poor girl died, and the Arabian\nwas left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country, and\nutterly ignorant of the customs of the world.",
        "She fell, however, into\ngood hands.",
        "The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which\nthey were bound; and, after her death, the woman of the house in which\nthey had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at the\ncottage of her lover.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.",
        "\u201cSuch was the history of my beloved cottagers.",
        "It impressed me deeply.",
        "I\nlearned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire\ntheir virtues, and to deprecate the vices of mankind.",
        "\u201cAs yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil; benevolence and\ngenerosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to\nbecome an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were\ncalled forth and displayed.",
        "But, in giving an account of the progress of\nmy intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the\nbeginning of the month of August of the same year.",
        "\u201cOne night, during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood, where I\ncollected my own food, and brought home firing for my protectors, I\nfound on the ground a leathern portmanteau, containing several articles\nof dress and some books.",
        "I eagerly seized the prize, and returned with\nit to my hovel.",
        "Fortunately the books were written in the language the\nelements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of\n_Paradise Lost_, a volume of _Plutarch\u2019s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of\nWerter_.",
        "The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I\nnow continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories,\nwhilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations.",
        "\u201cI can hardly describe to you the effect of these books.",
        "They produced\nin me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me\nto ecstacy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection.",
        "In\nthe _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and\naffecting story, so many opinions are canvassed, and so many lights\nthrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects, that I found\nin it a never-ending source of speculation and astonishment.",
        "The gentle\nand domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and\nfeelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded\nwell with my experience among my protectors, and with the wants which\nwere for ever alive in my own bosom.",
        "But I thought Werter himself a more\ndivine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character contained\nno pretension, but it sunk deep.",
        "The disquisitions upon death and\nsuicide were calculated to fill me with wonder.",
        "I did not pretend to\nenter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions\nof the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely understanding\nit.",
        "\u201cAs I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and\ncondition.",
        "I found myself similar, yet at the same time strangely unlike\nthe beings concerning whom I read, and to whose conversation I was a\nlistener.",
        "I sympathized with, and partly understood them, but I was\nunformed in mind; I was dependent on none, and related to none.",
        "\u2018The\npath of my departure was free;\u2019 and there was none to lament my\nannihilation.",
        "My person was hideous, and my stature gigantic: what did\nthis mean?",
        "Who was I?",
        "What was I?",
        "Whence did I come?",
        "What was my\ndestination?",
        "These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to\nsolve them.",
        "\u201cThe volume of _Plutarch\u2019s Lives_ which I possessed, contained the\nhistories of the first founders of the ancient republics.",
        "This book had\na far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_.",
        "I learned\nfrom Werter\u2019s imaginations despondency and gloom: but Plutarch taught me\nhigh thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own\nreflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages.",
        "Many things I\nread surpassed my understanding and experience.",
        "I had a very confused\nknowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and\nboundless seas.",
        "But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns, and large\nassemblages of men.",
        "The cottage of my protectors had been the only\nschool in which I had studied human nature; but this book developed new\nand mightier scenes of action.",
        "I read of men concerned in public affairs\ngoverning or massacring their species.",
        "I felt the greatest ardour for\nvirtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I understood\nthe signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied\nthem, to pleasure and pain alone.",
        "Induced by these feelings, I was of\ncourse led to admire peaceable law-givers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus,\nin preference to Romulus and Theseus.",
        "The patriarchal lives of my\nprotectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind;\nperhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young\nsoldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with\ndifferent sensations.",
        "\u201cBut _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions.",
        "I read\nit, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a\ntrue history.",
        "It moved every feeling of wonder and awe, that the picture\nof an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting.",
        "I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me,\nto my own.",
        "Like Adam, I was created apparently united by no link to any\nother being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in\nevery other respect.",
        "He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect\ncreature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his\nCreator; he was allowed to converse with, and acquire knowledge from\nbeings of a superior nature: but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.",
        "Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition; for\noften, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter\ngall of envy rose within me.",
        "\u201cAnother circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.",
        "Soon\nafter my arrival in the hovel, I discovered some papers in the pocket of\nthe dress which I had taken from your laboratory.",
        "At first I had\nneglected them; but now that I was able to decypher the characters in\nwhich they were written, I began to study them with diligence.",
        "It was\nyour journal of the four months that preceded my creation.",
        "You minutely\ndescribed in these papers every step you took in the progress of your\nwork; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences.",
        "You, doubtless, recollect these papers.",
        "Here they are.",
        "Every thing is\nrelated in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole\ndetail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is\nset in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person\nis given, in language which painted your own horrors, and rendered mine\nineffaceable.",
        "I sickened as I read.",
        "\u2018Hateful day when I received life!\u2019\nI exclaimed in agony.",
        "\u2018Cursed creator!",
        "Why did you form a monster so\nhideous that even you turned from me in disgust?",
        "God in pity made man\nbeautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy\ntype of your\u2019s, more horrid from its very resemblance.",
        "Satan had his\ncompanions, fellow-devils, to admire and encourage him; but I am\nsolitary and detested.\u2019\n\n\u201cThese were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude; but\nwhen I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and\nbenevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become\nacquainted with my admiration of their virtues, they would compassionate\nme, and overlook my personal deformity.",
        "Could they turn from their door\none, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion and friendship?",
        "I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for\nan interview with them which would decide my fate.",
        "I postponed this\nattempt for some months longer; for the importance attached to its\nsuccess inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.",
        "Besides, I found\nthat my understanding improved so much with every day\u2019s experience, that\nI was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months\nshould have added to my wisdom.",
        "\u201cSeveral changes, in the mean time, took place in the cottage.",
        "The\npresence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants; and I also\nfound that a greater degree of plenty reigned there.",
        "Felix and Agatha\nspent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in\ntheir labours by servants.",
        "They did not appear rich, but they were\ncontented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine\nbecame every day more tumultuous.",
        "Increase of knowledge only discovered\nto me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was.",
        "I cherished hope, it\nis true; but it vanished, when I beheld my person reflected in water, or\nmy shadow in the moon-shine, even as that frail image and that\ninconstant shade.",
        "\u201cI endeavoured to crush these fears, and to fortify myself for the trial\nwhich in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my\nthoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and\ndared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathizing with my\nfeelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed\nsmiles of consolation.",
        "But it was all a dream: no Eve soothed my\nsorrows, or shared my thoughts; I was alone.",
        "I remembered Adam\u2019s\nsupplication to his Creator; but where was mine?",
        "he had abandoned me,\nand, in the bitterness of my heart, I cursed him.",
        "\u201cAutumn passed thus.",
        "I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay\nand fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had\nworn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon.",
        "Yet I did not\nheed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my\nconformation for the endurance of cold than heat.",
        "But my chief delights\nwere the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of\nsummer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention towards the\ncottagers.",
        "Their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer.",
        "They loved, and sympathized with one another; and their joys, depending\non each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place\naround them.",
        "The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to\nclaim their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and\nloved by these amiable creatures: to see their sweet looks turned\ntowards me with affection, was the utmost limit of my ambition.",
        "I dared\nnot think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror.",
        "The\npoor that stopped at their door were never driven away.",
        "I asked, it is\ntrue, for greater treasures than a little food or rest; I required\nkindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of\nit.",
        "\u201cThe winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken\nplace since I awoke into life.",
        "My attention, at this time, was solely\ndirected towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my\nprotectors.",
        "I revolved many projects; but that on which I finally fixed\nwas, to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.",
        "I had\nsagacity enough to discover, that the unnatural hideousness of my person\nwas the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me.",
        "My\nvoice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore,\nthat if, in the absence of his children, I could gain the good-will and\nmediation of the old De Lacy, I might, by his means, be tolerated by my\nyounger protectors.",
        "\u201cOne day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground,\nand diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and\nFelix, departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own\ndesire, was left alone in the cottage.",
        "When his children had departed,\nhe took up his guitar, and played several mournful, but sweet airs, more\nsweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before.",
        "At first his\ncountenance was illuminated with pleasure, but, as he continued,\nthoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the\ninstrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.",
        "\u201cMy heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which\nwould decide my hopes, or realize my fears.",
        "The servants were gone to a\nneighbouring fair.",
        "All was silent in and around the cottage: it was an\nexcellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my\nlimbs failed me, and I sunk to the ground.",
        "Again I rose; and, exerting\nall the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had\nplaced before my hovel to conceal my retreat.",
        "The fresh air revived me,\nand, with renewed determination, I approached the door of their cottage.",
        "\u201cI knocked.",
        "\u2018Who is there?\u2019 said the old man\u2014\u2018Come in.\u2019\n\n\u201cI entered; \u2018Pardon this intrusion,\u2019 said I, \u2018I am a traveller in want\nof a little rest; you would greatly oblige me, if you would allow me to\nremain a few minutes before the fire.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Enter,\u2019 said De Lacy; \u2018and I will try in what manner I can relieve\nyour wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and, as I am\nblind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food for you.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Do not trouble yourself, my kind host, I have food; it is warmth and\nrest only that I need.\u2019\n\n\u201cI sat down, and a silence ensued.",
        "I knew that every minute was precious\nto me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence the\ninterview; when the old man addressed me\u2014\n\n\u201c\u2018By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman;\u2014are you\nFrench?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No; but I was educated by a French family, and understand that\nlanguage only.",
        "I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,\nwhom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Are these Germans?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018No, they are French.",
        "But let us change the subject.",
        "I am an\nunfortunate and deserted creature; I look around, and I have no relation\nor friend upon earth.",
        "These amiable people to whom I go have never seen\nme, and know little of me.",
        "I am full of fears; for if I fail there, I am\nan outcast in the world for ever.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Do not despair.",
        "To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate; but the\nhearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full\nof brotherly love and charity.",
        "Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if\nthese friends are good and amiable, do not despair.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018They are kind\u2014they are the most excellent creatures in the world;\nbut, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me.",
        "I have good\ndispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless, and, in some degree,\nbeneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they\nought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable\nmonster.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot\nyou undeceive them?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I\nfeel so many overwhelming terrors.",
        "I tenderly love these friends; I\nhave, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily\nkindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and\nit is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Where do these friends reside?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Near this spot.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe old man paused, and then continued, \u2018If you will unreservedly\nconfide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in\nundeceiving them.",
        "I am blind, and cannot judge of your countenance, but\nthere is something in your words which persuades me that you are\nsincere.",
        "I am poor, and an exile; but it will afford me true pleasure to\nbe in any way serviceable to a human creature.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Excellent man!",
        "I thank you, and accept your generous offer.",
        "You raise\nme from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I\nshall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your\nfellow-creatures.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Heaven forbid!",
        "even if you were really criminal; for that can only\ndrive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue.",
        "I also am\nunfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent:\njudge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?",
        "from your lips first\nhave I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be for\never grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with\nthose friends whom I am on the point of meeting.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018May I know the names and residence of those friends?\u2019\n\n\u201cI paused.",
        "This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob\nme of, or bestow happiness on me for ever.",
        "I struggled vainly for\nfirmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my\nremaining strength; I sank on the chair, and sobbed aloud.",
        "At that\nmoment I heard the steps of my younger protectors.",
        "I had not a moment to\nlose; but, seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, \u2018Now is the\ntime!\u2014save and protect me!",
        "You and your family are the friends whom I\nseek.",
        "Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Great God!\u2019 exclaimed the old man, \u2018who are you?\u2019\n\n\u201cAt that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and\nAgatha entered.",
        "Who can describe their horror and consternation on\nbeholding me?",
        "Agatha fainted; and Safie, unable to attend to her friend,\nrushed out of the cottage.",
        "Felix darted forward, and with supernatural\nforce tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung: in a transport of\nfury, he dashed me to the ground, and struck me violently with a stick.",
        "I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends the antelope.",
        "But my heart sunk within me as with bitter sickness, and I refrained.",
        "I\nsaw him on the point of repeating his blow, when, overcome by pain and\nanguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general tumult escaped\nunperceived to my hovel.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.",
        "\u201cCursed, cursed creator!",
        "Why did I live?",
        "Why, in that instant, did I not\nextinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed?",
        "I\nknow not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were\nthose of rage and revenge.",
        "I could with pleasure have destroyed the\ncottage and its inhabitants, and have glutted myself with their shrieks\nand misery.",
        "\u201cWhen night came, I quitted my retreat, and wandered in the wood; and\nnow, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my\nanguish in fearful howlings.",
        "I was like a wild beast that had broken the\ntoils; destroying the objects that obstructed me, and ranging through\nthe wood with a stag-like swiftness.",
        "Oh!",
        "what a miserable night I\npassed!",
        "the cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees waved their\nbranches above me: now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth\namidst the universal stillness.",
        "All, save I, were at rest or in\nenjoyment: I, like the arch fiend, bore a hell within me; and, finding\nmyself unsympathized with, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc and\ndestruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.",
        "\u201cBut this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became\nfatigued with excess of bodily exertion, and sank on the damp grass in\nthe sick impotence of despair.",
        "There was none among the myriads of men\nthat existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness\ntowards my enemies?",
        "No: from that moment I declared everlasting war\nagainst the species, and, more than all, against him who had formed me,\nand sent me forth to this insupportable misery.",
        "\u201cThe sun rose; I heard the voices of men, and knew that it was\nimpossible to return to my retreat during that day.",
        "Accordingly I hid\nmyself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours\nto reflection on my situation.",
        "\u201cThe pleasant sunshine, and the pure air of day, restored me to some\ndegree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the\ncottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my\nconclusions.",
        "I had certainly acted imprudently.",
        "It was apparent that my\nconversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a fool in\nhaving exposed my person to the horror of his children.",
        "I ought to have\nfamiliarized the old De Lacy to me, and by degrees have discovered\nmyself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared\nfor my approach.",
        "But I did not believe my errors to be irretrievable;\nand, after much consideration, I resolved to return to the cottage, seek\nthe old man, and by my representations win him to my party.",
        "\u201cThese thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound\nsleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by\npeaceful dreams.",
        "The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever\nacting before my eyes; the females were flying, and the enraged Felix\ntearing me from his father\u2019s feet.",
        "I awoke exhausted; and, finding that\nit was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in\nsearch of food.",
        "\u201cWhen my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the well-known\npath that conducted to the cottage.",
        "All there was at peace.",
        "I crept into\nmy hovel, and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when\nthe family arose.",
        "That hour past, the sun mounted high in the heavens,\nbut the cottagers did not appear.",
        "I trembled violently, apprehending\nsome dreadful misfortune.",
        "The inside of the cottage was dark, and I\nheard no motion; I cannot describe the agony of this suspence.",
        "\u201cPresently two countrymen passed by; but, pausing near the cottage, they\nentered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not\nunderstand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,\nwhich differed from that of my protectors.",
        "Soon after, however, Felix\napproached with another man: I was surprised, as I knew that he had not\nquitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover, from\nhis discourse, the meaning of these unusual appearances.",
        "\u201c\u2018Do you consider,\u2019 said his companion to him, \u2018that you will be obliged\nto pay three months\u2019 rent, and to lose the produce of your garden?",
        "I do\nnot wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will\ntake some days to consider of your determination.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018It is utterly useless,\u2019 replied Felix, \u2018we can never again inhabit\nyour cottage.",
        "The life of my father is in the greatest danger, owing to\nthe dreadful circumstance that I have related.",
        "My wife and my sister\nwill never recover their horror.",
        "I entreat you not to reason with me any\nmore.",
        "Take possession of your tenement, and let me fly from this place.\u2019\n\n\u201cFelix trembled violently as he said this.",
        "He and his companion entered\nthe cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then\ndeparted.",
        "I never saw any of the family of De Lacy more.",
        "\u201cI continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of\nutter and stupid despair.",
        "My protectors had departed, and had broken the\nonly link that held me to the world.",
        "For the first time the feelings of\nrevenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to controul\nthem; but, allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I bent my\nmind towards injury and death.",
        "When I thought of my friends, of the mild\nvoice of De Lacy, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of\nthe Arabian, these thoughts vanished, and a gush of tears somewhat\nsoothed me.",
        "But again, when I reflected that they had spurned and\ndeserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger; and, unable to injure any\nthing human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects.",
        "As night\nadvanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage; and,\nafter having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, I\nwaited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my\noperations.",
        "\u201cAs the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods, and quickly\ndispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens: the blast tore\nalong like a mighty avalanche, and produced a kind of insanity in my\nspirits, that burst all bounds of reason and reflection.",
        "I lighted the\ndry branch of a tree, and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,\nmy eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon\nnearly touched.",
        "A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my\nbrand; it sunk, and, with a loud scream, I fired the straw, and heath,\nand bushes, which I had collected.",
        "The wind fanned the fire, and the\ncottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it, and\nlicked it with their forked and destroying tongues.",
        "\u201cAs soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of\nthe habitation, I quitted the scene, and sought for refuge in the woods.",
        "\u201cAnd now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?",
        "I\nresolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated\nand despised, every country must be equally horrible.",
        "At length the\nthought of you crossed my mind.",
        "I learned from your papers that you were\nmy father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness than\nto him who had given me life?",
        "Among the lessons that Felix had bestowed\nupon Safie geography had not been omitted: I had learned from these the\nrelative situations of the different countries of the earth.",
        "You had\nmentioned Geneva as the name of your native town; and towards this place\nI resolved to proceed.",
        "\u201cBut how was I to direct myself?",
        "I knew that I must travel in a\nsouth-westerly direction to reach my destination; but the sun was my\nonly guide.",
        "I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass\nthrough, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I\ndid not despair.",
        "From you only could I hope for succour, although\ntowards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred.",
        "Unfeeling, heartless\ncreator!",
        "you had endowed me with perceptions and passions, and then cast\nme abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.",
        "But on you only\nhad I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek\nthat justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being that\nwore the human form.",
        "\u201cMy travels were long, and the sufferings I endured intense.",
        "It was late\nin autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.",
        "I\ntravelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human\nbeing.",
        "Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and\nsnow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the\nearth was hard, and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter.",
        "Oh, earth!",
        "how often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being!",
        "The mildness\nof my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall and\nbitterness.",
        "The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more deeply\ndid I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart.",
        "Snow fell, and\nthe waters were hardened, but I rested not.",
        "A few incidents now and then\ndirected me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I often wandered\nwide from my path.",
        "The agony of my feelings allowed me no respite: no\nincident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its\nfood; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived on the confines of\nSwitzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth, and the earth again\nbegan to look green, confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and\nhorror of my feelings.",
        "\u201cI generally rested during the day, and travelled only when I was\nsecured by night from the view of man.",
        "One morning, however, finding\nthat my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey\nafter the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,\ncheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of\nthe air.",
        "I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long\nappeared dead, revive within me.",
        "Half surprised by the novelty of these\nsensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them; and, forgetting\nmy solitude and deformity, dared to be happy.",
        "Soft tears again bedewed\nmy cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the\nblessed sun which bestowed such joy upon me.",
        "\u201cI continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its\nboundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many\nof the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.",
        "Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard the\nsound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a\ncypress.",
        "I was scarcely hid, when a young girl came running towards the\nspot where I was concealed, laughing as if she ran from some one in\nsport.",
        "She continued her course along the precipitous sides of the\nriver, when suddenly her foot slipt, and she fell into the rapid stream.",
        "I rushed from my hiding-place, and, with extreme labour from the force\nof the current, saved her, and dragged her to shore.",
        "She was senseless;\nand I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to restore animation,\nwhen I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic, who was\nprobably the person from whom she had playfully fled.",
        "On seeing me, he\ndarted towards me, and, tearing the girl from my arms, hastened towards\nthe deeper parts of the wood.",
        "I followed speedily, I hardly knew why;\nbut when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun, which he carried, at\nmy body, and fired.",
        "I sunk to the ground, and my injurer, with increased\nswiftness, escaped into the wood.",
        "\u201cThis was then the reward of my benevolence!",
        "I had saved a human being\nfrom destruction, and, as a recompense, I now writhed under the\nmiserable pain of a wound, which shattered the flesh and bone.",
        "The\nfeelings of kindness and gentleness, which I had entertained but a few\nmoments before, gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.",
        "Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.",
        "But the agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.",
        "\u201cFor some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to\ncure the wound which I had received.",
        "The ball had entered my shoulder,\nand I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any\nrate I had no means of extracting it.",
        "My sufferings were augmented also\nby the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their\ninfliction.",
        "My daily vows rose for revenge\u2014a deep and deadly revenge,\nsuch as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had\nendured.",
        "\u201cAfter some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey.",
        "The\nlabours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or\ngentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery, which insulted my\ndesolate state, and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for\nthe enjoyment of pleasure.",
        "\u201cBut my toils now drew near a close; and, two months from this time, I\nreached the environs of Geneva.",
        "\u201cIt was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among\nthe fields that surround it, to meditate in what manner I should apply\nto you.",
        "I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger, and far too unhappy to\nenjoy the gentle breezes of evening, or the prospect of the sun setting\nbehind the stupendous mountains of Jura.",
        "\u201cAt this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,\nwhich was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came\nrunning into the recess I had chosen with all the sportiveness of\ninfancy.",
        "Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me, that this\nlittle creature was unprejudiced, and had lived too short a time to have\nimbibed a horror of deformity.",
        "If, therefore, I could seize him, and\neducate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in\nthis peopled earth.",
        "\u201cUrged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed, and drew him\ntowards me.",
        "As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his\neyes, and uttered a shrill scream: I drew his hand forcibly from his\nface, and said, \u2018Child, what is the meaning of this?",
        "I do not intend to\nhurt you; listen to me.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe struggled violently; \u2018Let me go,\u2019 he cried; \u2018monster!",
        "ugly wretch!",
        "you wish to eat me, and tear me to pieces\u2014You are an ogre\u2014Let me go,\nor I will tell my papa.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Hideous monster!",
        "let me go; My papa is a Syndic\u2014he is M.\nFrankenstein\u2014he would punish you.",
        "You dare not keep me.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Frankenstein!",
        "you belong then to my enemy\u2014to him towards whom I have\nsworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe child still struggled, and loaded me with epithets which carried\ndespair to my heart: I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a\nmoment he lay dead at my feet.",
        "\u201cI gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish\ntriumph: clapping my hands, I exclaimed, \u2018I, too, can create desolation;\nmy enemy is not impregnable; this death will carry despair to him, and a\nthousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.\u2019\n\n\u201cAs I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his\nbreast.",
        "I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman.",
        "In spite of\nmy malignity, it softened and attracted me.",
        "For a few moments I gazed\nwith delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely\nlips; but presently my rage returned: I remembered that I was for ever\ndeprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow; and\nthat she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have\nchanged that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and\naffright.",
        "\u201cCan you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage?",
        "I only\nwonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in\nexclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind, and perish in the\nattempt to destroy them.",
        "\u201cWhile I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had\ncommitted the murder, and was seeking a more secluded hiding-place, when\nI perceived a woman passing near me.",
        "She was young, not indeed so\nbeautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect, and\nblooming in the loveliness of youth and health.",
        "Here, I thought, is one\nof those whose smiles are bestowed on all but me; she shall not escape:\nthanks to the lessons of Felix, and the sanguinary laws of man, I have\nlearned how to work mischief.",
        "I approached her unperceived, and placed\nthe portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress.",
        "\u201cFor some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place;\nsometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and\nits miseries for ever.",
        "At length I wandered towards these mountains, and\nhave ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning\npassion which you alone can gratify.",
        "We may not part until you have\npromised to comply with my requisition.",
        "I am alone, and miserable; man\nwill not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself\nwould not deny herself to me.",
        "My companion must be of the same species,\nand have the same defects.",
        "This being you must create.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.",
        "The being finished speaking, and fixed his looks upon me in expectation\nof a reply.",
        "But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my\nideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition.",
        "He\ncontinued\u2014\n\n\u201cYou must create a female for me, with whom I can live in the\ninterchange of those sympathies necessary for my being.",
        "This you alone\ncan do; and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse.\u201d\n\nThe latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had\ndied away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and,\nas he said this, I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within\nme.",
        "\u201cI do refuse it,\u201d I replied; \u201cand no torture shall ever extort a consent\nfrom me.",
        "You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall\nnever make me base in my own eyes.",
        "Shall I create another like yourself,\nwhose joint wickedness might desolate the world.",
        "Begone!",
        "I have answered\nyou; you may torture me, but I will never consent.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are in the wrong,\u201d replied the fiend; \u201cand, instead of threatening,\nI am content to reason with you.",
        "I am malicious because I am miserable;\nam I not shunned and hated by all mankind?",
        "You, my creator, would tear\nme to pieces, and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity\nman more than he pities me?",
        "You would not call it murder, if you could\nprecipitate me into one of those ice-rifts, and destroy my frame, the\nwork of your own hands.",
        "Shall I respect man, when he contemns me?",
        "Let\nhim live with me in the interchange of kindness, and, instead of injury,\nI would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his\nacceptance.",
        "But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable\nbarriers to our union.",
        "Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject\nslavery.",
        "I will revenge my injuries: if I cannot inspire love, I will\ncause fear; and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator,\ndo I swear inextinguishable hatred.",
        "Have a care: I will work at your\ndestruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you curse\nthe hour of your birth.\u201d\n\nA fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into\ncontortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he\ncalmed himself, and proceeded\u2014\n\n\u201cI intended to reason.",
        "This passion is detrimental to me; for you do not\nreflect that you are the cause of its excess.",
        "If any being felt emotions\nof benevolence towards me, I should return them an hundred and an\nhundred fold; for that one creature\u2019s sake, I would make peace with the\nwhole kind!",
        "But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be\nrealized.",
        "What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a\ncreature of another sex, but as hideous as myself: the gratification is\nsmall, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me.",
        "It is\ntrue, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that\naccount we shall be more attached to one another.",
        "Our lives will not be\nhappy, but they will be harmless, and free from the misery I now feel.",
        "Oh!",
        "my creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one\nbenefit!",
        "Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing;\ndo not deny me my request!\u201d\n\nI was moved.",
        "I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of\nmy consent; but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.",
        "His\ntale, and the feelings he now expressed, proved him to be a creature of\nfine sensations; and did I not, as his maker, owe him all the portion of\nhappiness that it was in my power to bestow?",
        "He saw my change of\nfeeling, and continued\u2014\n\n\u201cIf you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us\nagain: I will go to the vast wilds of South America.",
        "My food is not that\nof man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid, to glut my appetite;\nacorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment.",
        "My companion will\nbe of the same nature as myself, and will be content with the same fare.",
        "We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on\nman, and will ripen our food.",
        "The picture I present to you is peaceful\nand human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the\nwantonness of power and cruelty.",
        "Pitiless as you have been towards me, I\nnow see compassion in your eyes: let me seize the favourable moment, and\npersuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou propose,\u201d replied I, \u201cto fly from the habitations of man, to dwell\nin those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only\ncompanions.",
        "How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,\npersevere in this exile?",
        "You will return, and again seek their kindness,\nand you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be\nrenewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of\ndestruction.",
        "This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot\nconsent.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow inconstant are your feelings!",
        "but a moment ago you were moved by my\nrepresentations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?",
        "I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me,\nthat, with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of\nman, and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places.",
        "My evil\npassions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy; my life will\nflow quietly away, and, in my dying moments, I shall not curse my\nmaker.\u201d\n\nHis words had a strange effect upon me.",
        "I compassionated him, and\nsometimes felt a wish to console him; but when I looked upon him, when I\nsaw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened, and my\nfeelings were altered to those of horror and hatred.",
        "I tried to stifle\nthese sensations; I thought, that as I could not sympathize with him, I\nhad no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which\nwas yet in my power to bestow.",
        "\u201cYou swear,\u201d I said, \u201cto be harmless; but have you not already shewn a\ndegree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you?",
        "May not\neven this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a\nwider scope for your revenge?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is this?",
        "I thought I had moved your compassion, and yet you still\nrefuse to bestow on me the only benefit that can soften my heart, and\nrender me harmless.",
        "If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice\nmust be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my\ncrimes, and I shall become a thing, of whose existence every one will be\nignorant.",
        "My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor;\nand my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an\nequal.",
        "I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being, and become\nlinked to the chain of existence and events, from which I am now\nexcluded.\u201d\n\nI paused some time to reflect on all he had related, and the various\narguments which he had employed.",
        "I thought of the promise of virtues\nwhich he had displayed on the opening of his existence, and the\nsubsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which\nhis protectors had manifested towards him.",
        "His power and threats were\nnot omitted in my calculations: a creature who could exist in the ice\ncaves of the glaciers, and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of\ninaccessible precipices, was a being possessing faculties it would be\nvain to cope with.",
        "After a long pause of reflection, I concluded, that\nthe justice due both to him and my fellow-creatures demanded of me that\nI should comply with his request.",
        "Turning to him, therefore, I said\u2014\n\n\u201cI consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,\nand every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall\ndeliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.\u201d\n\n\u201cI swear,\u201d he cried, \u201cby the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, that if\nyou grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again.",
        "Depart to your home, and commence your labours: I shall watch their\nprogress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are\nready I shall appear.\u201d\n\nSaying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in\nmy sentiments.",
        "I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than\nthe flight of an eagle, and quickly lost him among the undulations of\nthe sea of ice.",
        "His tale had occupied the whole day; and the sun was upon the verge of\nthe horizon when he departed.",
        "I knew that I ought to hasten my descent\ntowards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my\nheart was heavy, and my steps slow.",
        "The labour of winding among the\nlittle paths of the mountains, and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced,\nperplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of\nthe day had produced.",
        "Night was far advanced, when I came to the\nhalf-way resting-place, and seated myself beside the fountain.",
        "The stars\nshone at intervals, as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines\nrose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the\nground: it was a scene of wonderful solemnity, and stirred strange\nthoughts within me.",
        "I wept bitterly; and, clasping my hands in agony, I\nexclaimed, \u201cOh!",
        "stars, and clouds, and winds, ye are all about to mock\nme: if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as\nnought; but if not, depart, depart and leave me in darkness.\u201d\n\nThese were wild and miserable thoughts; but I cannot describe to you how\nthe eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me, and how I listened\nto every blast of wind, as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to\nconsume me.",
        "Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; but my\npresence, so haggard and strange, hardly calmed the fears of my family,\nwho had waited the whole night in anxious expectation of my return.",
        "The following day we returned to Geneva.",
        "The intention of my father in\ncoming had been to divert my mind, and to restore me to my lost\ntranquillity; but the medicine had been fatal.",
        "And, unable to account\nfor the excess of misery I appeared to suffer, he hastened to return\nhome, hoping the quiet and monotony of a domestic life would by degrees\nalleviate my sufferings from whatsoever cause they might spring.",
        "For myself, I was passive in all their arrangements; and the gentle\naffection of my beloved Elizabeth was inadequate to draw me from the\ndepth of my despair.",
        "The promise I had made to the d\u00e6mon weighed upon my\nmind, like Dante\u2019s iron cowl on the heads of the hellish hypocrites.",
        "All\npleasures of earth and sky passed before me like a dream, and that\nthought only had to me the reality of life.",
        "Can you wonder, that\nsometimes a kind of insanity possessed me, or that I saw continually\nabout me a multitude of filthy animals inflicting on me incessant\ntorture, that often extorted screams and bitter groans?",
        "By degrees, however, these feelings became calmed.",

        "If you\nfeel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast\na gloom over us.",
        "But it is this gloom, which appears to have taken so\nstrong a hold of your mind, that I wish to dissipate.",
        "Tell me,\ntherefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnization of the\nmarriage.",
        "We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from\nthat every-day tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities.",
        "You are\nyounger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent\nfortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future\nplans of honour and utility that you may have formed.",
        "Do not suppose,\nhowever, that I wish to dictate happiness to you, or that a delay on\nyour part would cause me any serious uneasiness.",
        "Interpret my words\nwith candour, and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and\nsincerity.\u201d\n\nI listened to my father in silence, and remained for some time incapable\nof offering any reply.",
        "I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of\nthoughts, and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion.",
        "Alas!",
        "to me the\nidea of an immediate union with my cousin was one of horror and dismay.",
        "I was bound by a solemn promise, which I had not yet fulfilled, and\ndared not break; or, if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend\nover me and my devoted family!",
        "Could I enter into a festival with this\ndeadly weight yet hanging round my neck, and bowing me to the ground.",
        "I\nmust perform my engagement, and let the monster depart with his mate,\nbefore I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of an union from which I\nexpected peace.",
        "I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to\nEngland, or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers\nof that country, whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable\nuse to me in my present undertaking.",
        "The latter method of obtaining the\ndesired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory: besides, any\nvariation was agreeable to me, and I was delighted with the idea of\nspending a year or two in change of scene and variety of occupation, in\nabsence from my family; during which period some event might happen\nwhich would restore me to them in peace and happiness: my promise might\nbe fulfilled, and the monster have departed; or some accident might\noccur to destroy him, and put an end to my slavery for ever.",
        "These feelings dictated my answer to my father.",
        "I expressed a wish to\nvisit England; but, concealing the true reasons of this request, I\nclothed my desires under the guise of wishing to travel and see the\nworld before I sat down for life within the walls of my native town.",
        "I urged my entreaty with earnestness, and my father was easily induced\nto comply; for a more indulgent and less dictatorial parent did not\nexist upon earth.",

        "I should travel to\nStrasburgh, where Clerval would join me.",
        "Some short time would be spent\nin the towns of Holland, and our principal stay would be in England.",
        "We\nshould return by France; and it was agreed that the tour should occupy\nthe space of two years.",
        "My father pleased himself with the reflection, that my union with\nElizabeth should take place immediately on my return to Geneva.",
        "\u201cThese\ntwo years,\u201d said he, \u201cwill pass swiftly, and it will be the last delay\nthat will oppose itself to your happiness.",
        "And, indeed, I earnestly\ndesire that period to arrive, when we shall all be united, and neither\nhopes or fears arise to disturb our domestic calm.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am content,\u201d I replied, \u201cwith your arrangement.",
        "By that time we shall\nboth have become wiser, and I hope happier, than we at present are.\u201d I\nsighed; but my father kindly forbore to question me further concerning\nthe cause of my dejection.",
        "He hoped that new scenes, and the amusement\nof travelling, would restore my tranquillity.",
        "I now made arrangements for my journey; but one feeling haunted me,\nwhich filled me with fear and agitation.",
        "During my absence I should\nleave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy, and\nunprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my\ndeparture.",
        "But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go; and\nwould he not accompany me to England?",
        "This imagination was dreadful in\nitself, but soothing, inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.",
        "I was agonized with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this\nmight happen.",
        "But through the whole period during which I was the slave\nof my creature, I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the\nmoment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend\nwould follow me, and exempt my family from the danger of his\nmachinations.",
        "It was in the latter end of August that I departed, to pass two years of\nexile.",
        "Elizabeth approved of the reasons of my departure, and only\nregretted that she had not the same opportunities of enlarging her\nexperience, and cultivating her understanding.",
        "She wept, however, as she\nbade me farewell, and entreated me to return happy and tranquil.",
        "\u201cWe\nall,\u201d said she, \u201cdepend upon you; and if you are miserable, what must be\nour feelings?\u201d\n\nI threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly\nknowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.",
        "I\nremembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on\nit, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with\nme: for I resolved to fulfil my promise while abroad, and return, if\npossible, a free man.",
        "Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through\nmany beautiful and majestic scenes; but my eyes were fixed and\nunobserving.",
        "I could only think of the bourne of my travels, and the\nwork which was to occupy me whilst they endured.",
        "After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed\nmany leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for\nClerval.",
        "He came.",
        "Alas, how great was the contrast between us!",
        "He was\nalive to every new scene; joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting\nsun, and more happy when he beheld it rise, and recommence a new day.",
        "He\npointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape, and the\nappearances of the sky.",
        "\u201cThis is what it is to live;\u201d he cried, \u201cnow I\nenjoy existence!",
        "But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you\ndesponding and sorrowful?\u201d In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts,\nand neither saw the descent of the evening star, nor the golden sun-rise\nreflected in the Rhine.\u2014And you, my friend, would be far more amused\nwith the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of\nfeeling and delight, than to listen to my reflections.",
        "I, a miserable\nwretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.",
        "We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to\nRotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.",
        "During this voyage,\nwe passed by many willowy islands, and saw several beautiful towns.",
        "We\nstaid a day at Manheim, and, on the fifth from our departure from\nStrasburgh, arrived at Mayence.",
        "The course of the Rhine below Mayence\nbecomes much more picturesque.",
        "The river descends rapidly, and winds\nbetween hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms.",
        "We saw many\nruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black\nwoods, high and inaccessible.",
        "This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a\nsingularly variegated landscape.",
        "In one spot you view rugged hills,\nruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine\nrushing beneath; and, on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing\nvineyards, with green sloping banks, and a meandering river, and\npopulous towns, occupy the scene.",
        "We travelled at the time of the vintage, and heard the song of the\nlabourers, as we glided down the stream.",
        "Even I, depressed in mind, and\nmy spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased.",
        "I lay at the bottom of the boat, and, as I gazed on the cloudless blue\nsky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a\nstranger.",
        "And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of\nHenry?",
        "He felt as if he had been transported to Fairy-land, and enjoyed\na happiness seldom tasted by man.",
        "\u201cI have seen,\u201d he said, \u201cthe most\nbeautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne\nand Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the\nwater, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy\nand mournful appearance, were it not for the most verdant islands that\nrelieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated\nby a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water, and gave you an\nidea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean, and the waves\ndash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his\nmistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche, and where their dying voices\nare still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have\nseen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud: but this country,\nVictor, pleases me more than all those wonders.",
        "The mountains of\nSwitzerland are more majestic and strange; but there is a charm in the\nbanks of this divine river, that I never before saw equalled.",
        "Look at\nthat castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island,\nalmost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that\ngroup of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village\nhalf-hid in the recess of the mountain.",
        "Oh, surely, the spirit that\ninhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man, than\nthose who pile the glacier, or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the\nmountains of our own country.\u201d\n\nClerval!",
        "beloved friend!",

        "He\nwas a being formed in the \u201cvery poetry of nature.\u201d His wild and\nenthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart.",
        "His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of\nthat devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to\nlook for only in the imagination.",
        "But even human sympathies were not\nsufficient to satisfy his eager mind.",
        "The scenery of external nature,\nwhich others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:\n\n    \u2014\u2014 \u2014\u2014\u201cThe sounding cataract\n    Haunted _him_ like a passion: the tall rock,\n    The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\n    Their colours and their forms, were then to him\n    An appetite; a feeling, and a love,\n    That had no need of a remoter charm,\n    By thought supplied, or any interest\n    Unborrowed from the eye.\u201d\n\nAnd where does he now exist?",
        "Is this gentle and lovely being lost for\never?",
        "Has this mind so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and\nmagnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life\nof its creator; has this mind perished?",
        "Does it now only exist in my\nmemory?",
        "No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming\nwith beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your\nunhappy friend.",
        "Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight\ntribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,\noverflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates.",
        "I will\nproceed with my tale.",
        "Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to\npost the remainder of our way; for the wind was contrary, and the stream\nof the river was too gentle to aid us.",
        "Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery; but\nwe arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to\nEngland.",
        "It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that\nI first saw the white cliffs of Britain.",
        "The banks of the Thames\npresented a new scene; they were flat, but fertile, and almost every\ntown was marked by the remembrance of some story.",
        "We saw Tilbury Fort,\nand remembered the Spanish armada; Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich,\nplaces which I had heard of even in my country.",
        "At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St.",
        "Paul\u2019s towering\nabove all, and the Tower famed in English history.",
        "CHAPTER II.",
        "London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several\nmonths in this wonderful and celebrated city.",
        "Clerval desired the\nintercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time;\nbut this was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with\nthe means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of\nmy promise, and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction\nthat I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural\nphilosophers.",
        "If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,\nit would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure.",
        "But a blight had come\nover my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the\ninformation they might give me on the subject in which my interest was\nso terribly profound.",
        "Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could\nfill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry\nsoothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace.",
        "But\nbusy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to my heart.",
        "I saw\nan insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow-men; this\nbarrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine; and to reflect\non the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.",
        "But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive,\nand anxious to gain experience and instruction.",
        "The difference of\nmanners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of\ninstruction and amusement.",
        "He was for ever busy; and the only check to\nhis enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mien.",
        "I tried to conceal\nthis as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures\nnatural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by\nany care or bitter recollection.",
        "I often refused to accompany him,\nalleging another engagement, that I might remain alone.",
        "I now also began\nto collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to\nme like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the\nhead.",
        "Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and\nevery word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and\nmy heart to palpitate.",
        "After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person\nin Scotland, who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva.",
        "He mentioned\nthe beauties of his native country, and asked us if those were not\nsufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north\nas Perth, where he resided.",
        "Clerval eagerly desired to accept this\ninvitation; and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again\nmountains and streams, and all the wondrous works with which Nature\nadorns her chosen dwelling-places.",
        "We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now\nFebruary.",
        "We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the\nnorth at the expiration of another month.",
        "In this expedition we did not\nintend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor,\nOxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the\ncompletion of this tour about the end of July.",
        "I packed my chemical\ninstruments, and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my\nlabours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.",
        "We quitted London on the 27th of March, and remained a few days at\nWindsor, rambling in its beautiful forest.",
        "This was a new scene to us\nmountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of\nstately deer, were all novelties to us.",
        "From thence we proceeded to Oxford.",
        "As we entered this city, our minds\nwere filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted\nthere more than a century and a half before.",
        "It was here that Charles I.\nhad collected his forces.",
        "This city had remained faithful to him, after\nthe whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of\nparliament and liberty.",
        "The memory of that unfortunate king, and his\ncompanions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Gower, his queen, and\nson, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city, which they\nmight be supposed to have inhabited.",
        "The spirit of elder days found a\ndwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.",
        "If these\nfeelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the\ncity had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.",
        "The\ncolleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost\nmagnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows\nof exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,\nwhich reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes,\nembosomed among aged trees.",
        "I enjoyed this scene; and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the\nmemory of the past, and the anticipation of the future.",
        "I was formed for\npeaceful happiness.",
        "During my youthful days discontent never visited my\nmind; and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what is\nbeautiful in nature, or the study of what is excellent and sublime in\nthe productions of man, could always interest my heart, and communicate\nelasticity to my spirits.",
        "But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered\nmy soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit, what I shall\nsoon cease to be\u2014a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to\nothers, and abhorrent to myself.",
        "We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs,\nand endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most\nanimating epoch of English history.",
        "Our little voyages of discovery were\noften prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves.",
        "We\nvisited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden, and the field on which that\npatriot fell.",
        "For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and\nmiserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and\nself-sacrifice, of which these sights were the monuments and the\nremembrancers.",
        "For an instant I dared to shake off my chains, and look\naround me with a free and lofty spirit; but the iron had eaten into my\nflesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.",
        "We left Oxford with regret, and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next\nplace of rest.",
        "The country in the neighbourhood of this village\nresembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but every\nthing is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant\nwhite Alps, which always attend on the piny mountains of my native\ncountry.",
        "We visited the wondrous cave, and the little cabinets of\nnatural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner\nas in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.",
        "The latter name made me\ntremble, when pronounced by Henry; and I hastened to quit Matlock, with\nwhich that terrible scene was thus associated.",
        "From Derby still journeying northward, we passed two months in\nCumberland and Westmoreland.",
        "I could now almost fancy myself among the\nSwiss mountains.",
        "The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the\nnorthern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky\nstreams, were all familiar and dear sights to me.",
        "Here also we made some\nacquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness.",
        "The\ndelight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind\nexpanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature\ngreater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to\nhave possessed while he associated with his inferiors.",
        "\u201cI could pass my\nlife here,\u201d said he to me; \u201cand among these mountains I should scarcely\nregret Switzerland and the Rhine.\u201d\n\nBut he found that a traveller\u2019s life is one that includes much pain\namidst its enjoyments.",
        "His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and\nwhen he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit\nthat on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again\nengages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.",
        "We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and\nWestmoreland, and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants,\nwhen the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached,\nand we left them to travel on.",
        "For my own part I was not sorry.",
        "I had\nnow neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the\nd\u00e6mon\u2019s disappointment.",
        "He might remain in Switzerland, and wreak his\nvengeance on my relatives.",
        "This idea pursued me, and tormented me at\nevery moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and\npeace.",
        "I waited for my letters with feverish impatience: if they were\ndelayed, I was miserable, and overcome by a thousand fears; and when\nthey arrived, and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I\nhardly dared to read and ascertain my fate.",
        "Sometimes I thought that the\nfiend followed me, and might expedite my remissness by murdering my\ncompanion.",
        "When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for\na moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the\nfancied rage of his destroyer.",
        "I felt as if I had committed some great\ncrime, the consciousness of which haunted me.",
        "I was guiltless, but I had\nindeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of\ncrime.",
        "I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might\nhave interested the most unfortunate being.",
        "Clerval did not like it so\nwell as Oxford; for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing\nto him.",
        "But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its\nromantic castle, and its environs, the most delightful in the world,\nArthur\u2019s Seat, St.",
        "Bernard\u2019s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated\nhim for the change, and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration.",
        "But\nI was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.",
        "We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St.",
        "Andrews, and\nalong the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.",
        "But\nI was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers, or enter into their\nfeelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and\naccordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland\nalone.",
        "\u201cDo you,\u201d said I, \u201cenjoy yourself, and let this be our\nrendezvous.",
        "I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my\nmotions, I entreat you: leave me to peace and solitude for a short time;\nand when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more\ncongenial to your own temper.\u201d\n\nHenry wished to dissuade me; but, seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to\nremonstrate.",
        "He entreated me to write often.",
        "\u201cI had rather be with you,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cin your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom\nI do not know: hasten then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again\nfeel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your absence.\u201d\n\nHaving parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of\nScotland, and finish my work in solitude.",
        "I did not doubt but that the\nmonster followed me, and would discover himself to me when I should have\nfinished, that he might receive his companion.",
        "With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands, and fixed on\none of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene labours.",
        "It was a place\nfitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock, whose high sides\nwere continually beaten upon by the waves.",
        "The soil was barren, scarcely\naffording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its\ninhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy\nlimbs gave tokens of their miserable fare.",
        "Vegetables and bread, when\nthey indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured\nfrom the main land, which was about five miles distant.",
        "On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of\nthese was vacant when I arrived.",
        "This I hired.",
        "It contained but two\nrooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable\npenury.",
        "The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the\ndoor was off its hinges.",
        "I ordered it to be repaired, bought some\nfurniture, and took possession; an incident which would, doubtless, have\noccasioned some surprise, had not all the senses of the cottagers been\nbenumbed by want and squalid poverty.",
        "As it was, I lived ungazed at and\nunmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I\ngave; so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men.",
        "In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,\nwhen the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea, to\nlisten to the waves as they roared, and dashed at my feet.",
        "It was a\nmonotonous, yet ever-changing scene.",
        "I thought of Switzerland; it was\nfar different from this desolate and appalling landscape.",
        "Its hills are\ncovered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the\nplains.",
        "Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky; and, when troubled\nby the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant, when\ncompared to the roarings of the giant ocean.",
        "In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived; but,\nas I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and\nirksome to me.",
        "Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my\nlaboratory for several days; and at other times I toiled day and night\nin order to complete my work.",
        "It was indeed a filthy process in which I\nwas engaged.",
        "During my first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy\nhad blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently\nfixed on the sequel of my labour, and my eyes were shut to the horror of\nmy proceedings.",
        "But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often\nsickened at the work of my hands.",
        "Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a\nsolitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the\nactual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew\nrestless and nervous.",
        "Every moment I feared to meet my persecutor.",
        "Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them\nlest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold.",
        "I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow-creatures, lest when\nalone he should come to claim his companion.",
        "In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably\nadvanced.",
        "I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager\nhope, which I dared not trust myself to question, but which was\nintermixed with obscure forebodings of evil, that made my heart sicken\nin my bosom.",
        "CHAPTER III.",
        "I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was\njust rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment,\nand I remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should\nleave my labour for the night, or hasten its conclusion by an\nunremitting attention to it.",
        "As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to\nme, which led me to consider the effects of what I was now doing.",
        "Three\nyears before I was engaged in the same manner, and had created a fiend\nwhose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart, and filled it for\never with the bitterest remorse.",
        "I was now about to form another being,\nof whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten\nthousand times more malignant than her mate, and delight, for its own\nsake, in murder and wretchedness.",
        "He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood\nof man, and hide himself in deserts; but she had not; and she, who in\nall probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal, might\nrefuse to comply with a compact made before her creation.",
        "They might\neven hate each other; the creature who already lived loathed his own\ndeformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it\ncame before his eyes in the female form?",
        "She also might turn with\ndisgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and\nhe be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being\ndeserted by one of his own species.",
        "Even if they were to leave Europe, and inhabit the deserts of the new\nworld, yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the\nd\u00e6mon thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be\npropagated upon the earth, who might make the very existence of the\nspecies of man a condition precarious and full of terror.",
        "Had I a right,\nfor my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?",
        "I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I\nhad been struck senseless by his fiendish threats: but now, for the\nfirst time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to\nthink that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness\nhad not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price perhaps of the\nexistence of the whole human race.",
        "I trembled, and my heart failed within me; when, on looking up, I saw,\nby the light of the moon, the d\u00e6mon at the casement.",
        "A ghastly grin\nwrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task\nwhich he had allotted to me.",
        "Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he\nhad loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide\nand desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress, and claim the\nfulfilment of my promise.",
        "As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of\nmalice and treachery.",
        "I thought with a sensation of madness on my\npromise of creating another like to him, and, trembling with passion,\ntore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged.",
        "The wretch saw me\ndestroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for\nhappiness, and, with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.",
        "I left the room, and, locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own\nheart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I\nsought my own apartment.",
        "I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the\ngloom, and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible\nreveries.",
        "Several hours past, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it\nwas almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed\nunder the eye of the quiet moon.",
        "A few fishing vessels alone specked the\nwater, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices, as\nthe fishermen called to one another.",
        "I felt the silence, although I was\nhardly conscious of its extreme profundity until my ear was suddenly\narrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed\nclose to my house.",
        "In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one\nendeavoured to open it softly.",
        "I trembled from head to foot; I felt a\npresentiment of who it was, and wished to rouse one of the peasants who\ndwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the\nsensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you\nin vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the\nspot.",
        "Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door\nopened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared.",
        "Shutting the door, he\napproached me, and said, in a smothered voice\u2014\n\n\u201cYou have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you\nintend?",
        "Do you dare to break your promise?",
        "I have endured toil and\nmisery: I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the\nRhine, among its willow islands, and over the summits of its hills.",
        "I\nhave dwelt many months in the heaths of England, and among the deserts\nof Scotland.",
        "I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger;\ndo you dare destroy my hopes?\u201d\n\n\u201cBegone!",
        "I do break my promise; never will I create another like\nyourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.\u201d\n\n\u201cSlave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself\nunworthy of my condescension.",
        "Remember that I have power; you believe\nyourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day\nwill be hateful to you.",
        "You are my creator, but I am your\nmaster;\u2014obey!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hour of my weakness is past, and the period of your power is\narrived.",
        "Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but\nthey confirm me in a resolution of not creating you a companion in vice.",
        "Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a d\u00e6mon, whose delight\nis in death and wretchedness.",
        "Begone!",
        "I am firm, and your words will\nonly exasperate my rage.\u201d\n\nThe monster saw my determination in my face, and gnashed his teeth in\nthe impotence of anger.",
        "\u201cShall each man,\u201d cried he, \u201cfind a wife for his\nbosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone?",
        "I had feelings of\naffection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.",
        "Man, you may\nhate; but beware!",
        "Your hours will pass in dread and misery, and soon the\nbolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever.",
        "Are\nyou to be happy, while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness?",
        "You\ncan blast my other passions; but revenge remains\u2014revenge, henceforth\ndearer than light or food!",
        "I may die; but first you, my tyrant and\ntormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery.",
        "Beware; for I\nam fearless, and therefore powerful.",
        "I will watch with the wiliness of a\nsnake, that I may sting with its venom.",
        "Man, you shall repent of the\ninjuries you inflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cDevil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.",
        "I\nhave declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath\nwords.",
        "Leave me; I am inexorable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is well.",
        "I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your\nwedding-night.\u201d\n\nI started forward, and exclaimed, \u201cVillain!",
        "before you sign my\ndeath-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.\u201d\n\nI would have seized him; but he eluded me, and quitted the house with\nprecipitation: in a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across\nthe waters with an arrowy swiftness, and was soon lost amidst the waves.",
        "All was again silent; but his words rung in my ears.",
        "I burned with rage\nto pursue the murderer of my peace, and precipitate him into the ocean.",
        "I walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination\nconjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me.",
        "Why had I not\nfollowed him, and closed with him in mortal strife?",
        "But I had suffered\nhim to depart, and he had directed his course towards the main land.",
        "I\nshuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his\ninsatiate revenge.",
        "And then I thought again of his words\u2014\u201c_I will be\nwith you on your wedding-night._\u201d That then was the period fixed for the\nfulfilment of my destiny.",
        "In that hour I should die, and at once satisfy\nand extinguish his malice.",
        "The prospect did not move me to fear; yet\nwhen I thought of my beloved Elizabeth,\u2014of her tears and endless\nsorrow, when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from\nher,\u2014tears, the first I had shed for many months, streamed from my\neyes, and I resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter\nstruggle.",
        "The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings\nbecame calmer, if it may be called calmness, when the violence of rage\nsinks into the depths of despair.",
        "I left the house, the horrid scene of\nthe last night\u2019s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I\nalmost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my\nfellow-creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole\nacross me.",
        "I desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock,\nwearily it is true, but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery.",
        "If\nI returned, it was to be sacrificed, or to see those whom I most loved\ndie under the grasp of a d\u00e6mon whom I had myself created.",
        "I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it\nloved, and miserable in the separation.",
        "When it became noon, and the sun\nrose higher, I lay down on the grass, and was overpowered by a deep\nsleep.",
        "I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were\nagitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.",
        "The sleep into\nwhich I now sunk refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as if I\nbelonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to reflect\nupon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the words of the\nfiend rung in my ears like a death-knell, they appeared like a dream,\nyet distinct and oppressive as a reality.",
        "The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\nappetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a\nfishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;\nit contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval, entreating me to\njoin him.",
        "He said that nearly a year had elapsed since we had quitted\nSwitzerland, and France was yet unvisited.",
        "He entreated me, therefore,\nto leave my solitary isle, and meet him at Perth, in a week from that\ntime, when we might arrange the plan of our future proceedings.",
        "This\nletter in a degree recalled me to life, and I determined to quit my\nisland at the expiration of two days.",
        "Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I\nshuddered to reflect: I must pack my chemical instruments; and for that\npurpose I must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious\nwork, and I must handle those utensils, the sight of which was sickening\nto me.",
        "The next morning, at day-break, I summoned sufficient courage,\nand unlocked the door of my laboratory.",
        "The remains of the half-finished\ncreature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost\nfelt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being.",
        "I paused to\ncollect myself, and then entered the chamber.",
        "With trembling hand I\nconveyed the instruments out of the room; but I reflected that I ought\nnot to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of\nthe peasants, and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great\nquantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into\nthe sea that very night; and in the mean time I sat upon the beach,\nemployed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.",
        "Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place\nin my feelings since the night of the appearance of the d\u00e6mon.",
        "I had\nbefore regarded my promise with a gloomy despair, as a thing that, with\nwhatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film\nhad been taken from before my eyes, and that I, for the first time, saw\nclearly.",
        "The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\nto me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not\nreflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.",
        "I had resolved in\nmy own mind, that to create another like the fiend I had first made\nwould be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness; and I\nbanished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\nconclusion.",
        "Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting\nmy basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the\nshore.",
        "The scene was perfectly solitary: a few boats were returning\ntowards land, but I sailed away from them.",
        "I felt as if I was about the\ncommission of a dreadful crime, and avoided with shuddering anxiety any\nencounter with my fellow-creatures.",
        "At one time the moon, which had\nbefore been clear, was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took\nadvantage of the moment of darkness, and cast my basket into the sea; I\nlistened to the gurgling sound as it sunk, and then sailed away from the\nspot.",
        "The sky became clouded; but the air was pure, although chilled by\nthe north-east breeze that was then rising.",
        "But it refreshed me, and\nfilled me with such agreeable sensations, that I resolved to prolong my\nstay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched\nmyself at the bottom of the boat.",
        "Clouds hid the moon, every thing was\nobscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat, as its keel cut through\nthe waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I slept soundly.",
        "I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I\nfound that the sun had already mounted considerably.",
        "The wind was high,\nand the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff.",
        "I\nfound that the wind was north-east, and must have driven me far from the\ncoast from which I had embarked.",
        "I endeavoured to change my course, but\nquickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be\ninstantly filled with water.",
        "Thus situated, my only resource was to\ndrive before the wind.",
        "I confess that I felt a few sensations of terror.",
        "I had no compass with me, and was so little acquainted with the\ngeography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit\nto me.",
        "I might be driven into the wide Atlantic, and feel all the\ntortures of starvation, or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters\nthat roared and buffeted around me.",
        "I had already been out many hours,\nand felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other\nsufferings.",
        "I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that\nflew before the wind only to be replaced by others: I looked upon the\nsea, it was to be my grave.",
        "\u201cFiend,\u201d I exclaimed, \u201cyour task is already\nfulfilled!\u201d I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and of Clerval; and\nsunk into a reverie, so despairing and frightful, that even now, when\nthe scene is on the point of closing before me for ever, I shudder to\nreflect on it.",
        "Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\nhorizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze, and the sea became\nfree from breakers.",
        "But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick,\nand hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high\nland towards the south.",
        "Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue, and the dreadful suspense I endured\nfor several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of\nwarm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.",
        "How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we\nhave of life even in the excess of misery!",
        "I constructed another sail\nwith a part of my dress, and eagerly steered my course towards the land.",
        "It had a wild and rocky appearance; but as I approached nearer, I easily\nperceived the traces of cultivation.",
        "I saw vessels near the shore, and\nfound myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilized\nman.",
        "I eagerly traced the windings of the land, and hailed a steeple\nwhich I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory.",
        "As I was\nin a state of extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the\ntown as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment.",
        "Fortunately I had money with me.",
        "As I turned the promontory, I perceived\na small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding\nwith joy at my unexpected escape.",
        "As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\npeople crowded towards the spot.",
        "They seemed very much surprised at my\nappearance; but, instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\ntogether with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\na slight sensation of alarm.",
        "As it was, I merely remarked that they\nspoke English; and I therefore addressed them in that language: \u201cMy good\nfriends,\u201d said I, \u201cwill you be so kind as to tell me the name of this\ntown, and inform me where I am?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will know that soon enough,\u201d replied a man with a gruff voice.",
        "\u201cMay\nbe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste; but\nyou will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.\u201d\n\nI was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a\nstranger; and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\nangry countenances of his companions.",
        "\u201cWhy do you answer me so roughly?\u201d\nI replied: \u201csurely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive\nstrangers so inhospitably.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know,\u201d said the man, \u201cwhat the custom of the English may be;\nbut it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.\u201d\n\nWhile this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\nincrease.",
        "Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\nannoyed, and in some degree alarmed me.",
        "I inquired the way to the inn;\nbut no one replied.",
        "I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose\nfrom the crowd as they followed and surrounded me; when an ill-looking\nman approaching, tapped me on the shoulder, and said, \u201cCome, Sir, you\nmust follow me to Mr.",
        "Kirwin\u2019s, to give an account of yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is Mr.",
        "Kirwin?",
        "Why am I to give an account of myself?",
        "Is not this a\nfree country?\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, Sir, free enough for honest folks.",
        "Mr.",
        "Kirwin is a magistrate; and\nyou are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found\nmurdered here last night.\u201d\n\nThis answer startled me; but I presently recovered myself.",
        "I was\ninnocent; that could easily be proved: accordingly I followed my\nconductor in silence, and was led to one of the best houses in the town.",
        "I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger; but, being surrounded by a\ncrowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical\ndebility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt.",
        "Little\ndid I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm\nme, and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death.",
        "I must pause here; for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory\nof the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to\nmy recollection.",
        "CHAPTER IV.",
        "I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old\nbenevolent man, with calm and mild manners.",
        "He looked upon me, however,\nwith some degree of severity; and then, turning towards my conductors,\nhe asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.",
        "About half a dozen men came forward; and one being selected by the\nmagistrate, he deposed, that he had been out fishing the night before\nwith his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o\u2019clock,\nthey observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put\nin for port.",
        "It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen;\nthey did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a\ncreek about two miles below.",
        "He walked on first, carrying a part of the\nfishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance.",
        "As he\nwas proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something,\nand fell all his length on the ground.",
        "His companions came up to assist\nhim; and, by the light of their lantern, they found that he had fallen\non the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead.",
        "Their first\nsupposition was, that it was the corpse of some person who had been\ndrowned, and was thrown on shore by the waves; but, upon examination,\nthey found that the clothes were not wet, and even that the body was not\nthen cold.",
        "They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near\nthe spot, and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life.",
        "He\nappeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty years of age.",
        "He had apparently been strangled; for there was no sign of any violence,\nexcept the black mark of fingers on his neck.",
        "The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me; but\nwhen the mark of the fingers was mentioned, I remembered the murder of\nmy brother, and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\nmist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for support.",
        "The magistrate observed me with a keen eye, and of course drew an\nunfavourable augury from my manner.",
        "The son confirmed his father\u2019s account: but when Daniel Nugent was\ncalled, he swore positively that, just before the fall of his companion,\nhe saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the\nshore; and, as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was\nthe same boat in which I had just landed.",
        "A woman deposed, that she lived near the beach, and was standing at the\ndoor of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an\nhour before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat,\nwith only one man in it, push off from that part of the shore where the\ncorpse was afterwards found.",
        "Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the\nbody into her house; it was not cold.",
        "They put it into a bed, and rubbed\nit; and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite\ngone.",
        "Several other men were examined concerning my landing; and they agreed,\nthat, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it\nwas very probable that I had beaten about for many hours, and had been\nobliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.",
        "Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from\nanother place, and it was likely, that as I did not appear to know the\nshore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the\ntown of \u2014\u2014 from the place where I had deposited the corpse.",
        "Mr.",
        "Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken\ninto the room where the body lay for interment that it might be observed\nwhat effect the sight of it would produce upon me.",
        "This idea was\nprobably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the\nmode of the murder had been described.",
        "I was accordingly conducted, by\nthe magistrate and several other persons, to the inn.",
        "I could not help\nbeing struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during\nthis eventful night; but, knowing that I had been conversing with\nseveral persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the\nbody had been found, I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of\nthe affair.",
        "I entered the room where the corpse lay, and was led up to the coffin.",
        "How can I describe my sensations on beholding it?",
        "I feel yet parched\nwith horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without\nshuddering and agony, that faintly reminds me of the anguish of the\nrecognition.",
        "The trial, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,\npassed like a dream from my memory, when I saw the lifeless form of\nHenry Clerval stretched before me.",
        "I gasped for breath; and, throwing\nmyself on the body, I exclaimed, \u201cHave my murderous machinations\ndeprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life?",
        "Two I have already\ndestroyed; other victims await their destiny: but you, Clerval, my\nfriend, my benefactor\u201d\u2014\u2014\n\nThe human frame could no longer support the agonizing suffering that I\nendured, and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.",
        "A fever succeeded to this.",
        "I lay for two months on the point of death:\nmy ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the\nmurderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval.",
        "Sometimes I entreated\nmy attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was\ntormented; and, at others, I felt the fingers of the monster already\ngrasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror.",
        "Fortunately,\nas I spoke my native language, Mr.",
        "Kirwin alone understood me; but my\ngestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other\nwitnesses.",
        "Why did I not die?",
        "More miserable than man ever was before, why did I\nnot sink into forgetfulness and rest?",
        "Death snatches away many blooming\nchildren, the only hopes of their doating parents: how many brides and\nyouthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and\nthe next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb!",
        "Of what materials\nwas I made, that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the\nturning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture.",
        "But I was doomed to live; and, in two months, found myself as awaking\nfrom a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\ngaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.",
        "It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding: I had\nforgotten the particulars of what had happened, and only felt as if some\ngreat misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around,\nand saw the barred windows, and the squalidness of the room in which I\nwas, all flashed across my memory, and I groaned bitterly.",
        "This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me.",
        "She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\ncountenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterize\nthat class.",
        "The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\npersons accustomed to see without sympathizing in sights of misery.",
        "Her\ntone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English, and\nthe voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings:\n\n\u201cAre you better now, Sir?\u201d said she.",
        "I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, \u201cI believe I am;\nbut if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am\nstill alive to feel this misery and horror.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor that matter,\u201d replied the old woman, \u201cif you mean about the\ngentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you\nwere dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you; but you will be hung\nwhen the next sessions come on.",
        "However, that\u2019s none of my business, I\nam sent to nurse you, and get you well; I do my duty with a safe\nconscience, it were well if every body did the same.\u201d\n\nI turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\nspeech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt\nlanguid, and unable to reflect on all that had passed.",
        "The whole series\nof my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it\nwere all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\nof reality.",
        "As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew\nfeverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\nme with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.",
        "The\nphysician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them\nfor me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\nexpression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second.",
        "Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer, but the hangman who\nwould gain his fee?",
        "These were my first reflections; but I soon learned that Mr.",
        "Kirwin had\nshewn me extreme kindness.",
        "He had caused the best room in the prison to\nbe prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who had\nprovided a physician and a nurse.",
        "It is true, he seldom came to see me;\nfor, although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every\nhuman creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\nmiserable ravings of a murderer.",
        "He came, therefore, sometimes to see\nthat I was not neglected; but his visits were short, and at long\nintervals.",
        "One day, when I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my\neyes half open, and my cheeks livid like those in death, I was overcome\nby gloom and misery, and often reflected I had better seek death than\nremain miserably pent up only to be let loose in a world replete with\nwretchedness.",
        "At one time I considered whether I should not declare\nmyself guilty, and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than\npoor Justine had been.",
        "Such were my thoughts, when the door of my\napartment was opened, and Mr.",
        "Kirwin entered.",
        "His countenance expressed\nsympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine, and addressed me\nin French\u2014\n\n\u201cI fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do any thing to\nmake you more comfortable?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank you; but all that you mention is nothing to me: on the whole\nearth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\none borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.",
        "But you will, I\nhope, soon quit this melancholy abode; for, doubtless, evidence can\neasily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is my least concern: I am, by a course of strange events, become\nthe most miserable of mortals.",
        "Persecuted and tortured as I am and have\nbeen, can death be any evil to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange\nchances that have lately occurred.",
        "You were thrown, by some surprising\naccident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality: seized\nimmediately, and charged with murder.",
        "The first sight that was presented\nto your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a\nmanner, and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path.\u201d\n\nAs Mr.",
        "Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this\nretrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at the\nknowledge he seemed to possess concerning me.",
        "I suppose some\nastonishment was exhibited in my countenance; for Mr.",
        "Kirwin hastened to\nsay\u2014\n\n\u201cIt was not until a day or two after your illness that I thought of\nexamining your dress, that I might discover some trace by which I could\nsend to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness.",
        "I\nfound several letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from\nits commencement to be from your father.",
        "I instantly wrote to Geneva:\nnearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\u2014But\nyou are ill; even now you tremble: you are unfit for agitation of any\nkind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event:\ntell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am\nnow to lament.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour family is perfectly well,\u201d said Mr.",
        "Kirwin, with gentleness; \u201cand\nsome one, a friend, is come to visit you.\u201d\n\nI know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it\ninstantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my\nmisery, and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for\nme to comply with his hellish desires.",
        "I put my hand before my eyes, and\ncried out in agony\u2014\n\n\u201cOh!",
        "take him away!",
        "I cannot see him; for God\u2019s sake, do not let him\nenter!\u201d\n\nMr.",
        "Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.",
        "He could not help\nregarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt, and said, in\nrather a severe tone\u2014\n\n\u201cI should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father\nwould have been welcome, instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father!\u201d cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed\nfrom anguish to pleasure.",
        "\u201cIs my father, indeed, come?",
        "How kind, how\nvery kind.",
        "But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?\u201d\n\nMy change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he\nthought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,\nand now he instantly resumed his former benevolence.",
        "He rose, and\nquitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.",
        "Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the\narrival of my father.",
        "I stretched out my hand to him, and cried\u2014\n\n\u201cAre you then safe\u2014and Elizabeth\u2014and Ernest?\u201d\n\nMy father calmed me with assurances of their welfare, and endeavoured,\nby dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my\ndesponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode\nof cheerfulness.",
        "\u201cWhat a place is this that you inhabit, my son!\u201d said\nhe, looking mournfully at the barred windows, and wretched appearance of\nthe room.",
        "\u201cYou travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to\npursue you.",
        "And poor Clerval\u2014\u201d\n\nThe name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too\ngreat to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.",
        "\u201cAlas!",
        "yes, my father,\u201d replied I; \u201csome destiny of the most horrible\nkind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I should\nhave died on the coffin of Henry.\u201d\n\nWe were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\nprecarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that\ncould insure tranquillity.",
        "Mr.",
        "Kirwin came in, and insisted that my\nstrength should not be exhausted by too much exertion.",
        "But the\nappearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I\ngradually recovered my health.",
        "As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black\nmelancholy, that nothing could dissipate.",
        "The image of Clerval was for\never before me, ghastly and murdered.",
        "More than once the agitation into\nwhich these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous\nrelapse.",
        "Alas!",
        "why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life?",
        "It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now drawing to a\nclose.",
        "Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings, and\nrelieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust;\nand, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest.",
        "Then\nthe appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present\nto my thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless,\nwishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer\nin its ruins.",
        "The season of the assizes approached.",
        "I had already been three months\nin prison; and although I was still weak, and in continual danger of a\nrelapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the\ncounty-town, where the court was held.",
        "Mr.",
        "Kirwin charged himself with\nevery care of collecting witnesses, and arranging my defence.",
        "I was\nspared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was\nnot brought before the court that decides on life and death.",
        "The grand\njury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney\nIslands at the hour the body of my friend was found, and a fortnight\nafter my removal I was liberated from prison.",
        "My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a\ncriminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh\natmosphere, and allowed to return to my native country.",
        "I did not\nparticipate in these feelings; for to me the walls of a dungeon or a\npalace were alike hateful.",
        "The cup of life was poisoned for ever; and\nalthough the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I\nsaw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by\nno light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me.",
        "Sometimes they\nwere the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs\nnearly covered by the lids, and the long black lashes that fringed them;\nsometimes it was the watery clouded eyes of the monster, as I first saw\nthem in my chamber at Ingolstadt.",
        "My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection.",
        "He talked of\nGeneva, which I should soon visit\u2014of Elizabeth, and Ernest; but these\nwords only drew deep groans from me.",
        "Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish\nfor happiness; and thought, with melancholy delight, of my beloved\ncousin; or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more\nthe blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early\nchildhood: but my general state of feeling was a torpor, in which a\nprison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\nthese fits were seldom interrupted, but by paroxysms of anguish and\ndespair.",
        "At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the\nexistence I loathed; and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance\nto restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.",
        "I remember, as I quitted the prison, I heard one of the men say, \u201cHe may\nbe innocent of the murder, but he has certainly a bad conscience.\u201d These\nwords struck me.",
        "A bad conscience!",
        "yes, surely I had one.",
        "William,\nJustine, and Clerval, had died through my infernal machinations; \u201cAnd\nwhose death,\u201d cried I, \u201cis to finish the tragedy?",
        "Ah!",
        "my father, do not\nremain in this wretched country; take me where I may forget myself, my\nexistence, and all the world.\u201d\n\nMy father easily acceded to my desire; and, after having taken leave of\nMr.",
        "Kirwin, we hastened to Dublin.",
        "I felt as if I was relieved from a\nheavy weight, when the packet sailed with a fair wind from Ireland, and\nI had quitted for ever the country which had been to me the scene of so\nmuch misery.",
        "It was midnight.",
        "My father slept in the cabin; and I lay on the deck,\nlooking at the stars, and listening to the dashing of the waves.",
        "I\nhailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat\nwith a feverish joy, when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva.",
        "The\npast appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream; yet the vessel in\nwhich I was, the wind that blew me from the detested shore of Ireland,\nand the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly that I was\ndeceived by no vision, and that Clerval, my friend and dearest\ncompanion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation.",
        "I\nrepassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing\nwith my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\nIngolstadt.",
        "I remembered shuddering at the mad enthusiasm that hurried\nme on to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the\nnight during which he first lived.",
        "I was unable to pursue the train of\nthought; a thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.",
        "Ever since my recovery from the fever I had been in the custom of taking\nevery night a small quantity of laudanum; for it was by means of this\ndrug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the\npreservation of life.",
        "Oppressed by the recollection of my various\nmisfortunes, I now took a double dose, and soon slept profoundly.",
        "But\nsleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams\npresented a thousand objects that scared me.",
        "Towards morning I was\npossessed by a kind of night-mare; I felt the fiend\u2019s grasp in my neck,\nand could not free myself from it; groans and cries rung in my ears.",
        "My\nfather, who was watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me,\nand pointed to the port of Holyhead, which we were now entering.",
        "CHAPTER V.\n\n\nWe had resolved not to go to London, but to cross the country to\nPortsmouth, and thence to embark for Havre.",
        "I preferred this plan\nprincipally because I dreaded to see again those places in which I had\nenjoyed a few moments of tranquillity with my beloved Clerval.",
        "I thought\nwith horror of seeing again those persons whom we had been accustomed to\nvisit together, and who might make inquiries concerning an event, the\nvery remembrance of which made me again feel the pang I endured when I\ngazed on his lifeless form in the inn at \u2014\u2014.",
        "As for my father, his desires and exertions were bounded to the again\nseeing me restored to health and peace of mind.",
        "His tenderness and\nattentions were unremitting; my grief and gloom was obstinate, but he\nwould not despair.",
        "Sometimes he thought that I felt deeply the\ndegradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he\nendeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.",
        "\u201cAlas!",
        "my father,\u201d said I, \u201chow little do you know me.",
        "Human beings,\ntheir feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded, if such a wretch\nas I felt pride.",
        "Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I,\nand she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause\nof this\u2014I murdered her.",
        "William, Justine, and Henry\u2014they all died by\nmy hands.\u201d\n\nMy father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same\nassertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an\nexplanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as caused by\ndelirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had\npresented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved\nin my convalescence.",
        "I avoided explanation, and maintained a continual\nsilence concerning the wretch I had created.",
        "I had a feeling that I\nshould be supposed mad, and this for ever chained my tongue, when I\nwould have given the whole world to have confided the fatal secret.",
        "Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded\nwonder, \u201cWhat do you mean, Victor?",
        "are you mad?",
        "My dear son, I entreat\nyou never to make such an assertion again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not mad,\u201d I cried energetically; \u201cthe sun and the heavens, who\nhave viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth.",
        "I am the\nassassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.",
        "A\nthousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have\nsaved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not\nsacrifice the whole human race.\u201d\n\nThe conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were\nderanged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation, and\nendeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts.",
        "He wished as much as\npossible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in\nIreland, and never alluded to them, or suffered me to speak of my\nmisfortunes.",
        "As time passed away I became more calm: misery had her dwelling in my\nheart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own\ncrimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them.",
        "By the utmost\nself-violence, I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which\nsometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world; and my manners\nwere calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey\nto the sea of ice.",
        "We arrived at Havre on the 8th of May, and instantly proceeded to Paris,\nwhere my father had some business which detained us a few weeks.",
        "In this\ncity, I received the following letter from Elizabeth:\u2014\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u201c_To_ VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN.",
        "\u201cMY DEAREST FRIEND,\n\n\u201cIt gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle\ndated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may\nhope to see you in less than a fortnight.",
        "My poor cousin, how much you\nmust have suffered!",
        "I expect to see you looking even more ill than when\nyou quitted Geneva.",
        "This winter has been passed most miserably, tortured\nas I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in your\ncountenance, and to find that your heart is not totally devoid of\ncomfort and tranquillity.",
        "\u201cYet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable\na year ago, even perhaps augmented by time.",
        "I would not disturb you at\nthis period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you; but a conversation\nthat I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some\nexplanation necessary before we meet.",
        "\u201cExplanation!",
        "you may possibly say; what can Elizabeth have to explain?",
        "If you really say this, my questions are answered, and I have no more to\ndo than to sign myself your affectionate cousin.",
        "But you are distant\nfrom me, and it is possible that you may dread, and yet be pleased with\nthis explanation; and, in a probability of this being the case, I dare\nnot any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often\nwished to express to you, but have never had the courage to begin.",
        "\u201cYou well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of\nyour parents ever since our infancy.",
        "We were told this when young, and\ntaught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take\nplace.",
        "We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I\nbelieve, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older.",
        "But as\nbrother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each\nother, without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our\ncase?",
        "Tell me, dearest Victor.",
        "Answer me, I conjure you, by our mutual\nhappiness, with simple truth\u2014Do you not love another?",
        "\u201cYou have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at\nIngolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last\nautumn so unhappy, flying to solitude, from the society of every\ncreature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our\nconnexion, and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of\nyour parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.",
        "But\nthis is false reasoning.",
        "I confess to you, my cousin, that I love you,\nand that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend\nand companion.",
        "But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own, when\nI declare to you, that our marriage would render me eternally miserable,\nunless it were the dictate of your own free choice.",
        "Even now I weep to\nthink, that, borne down as you are by the cruelest misfortunes, you may\nstifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that love and happiness which\nwould alone restore you to yourself.",
        "I, who have so interested an\naffection for you, may increase your miseries ten-fold, by being an\nobstacle to your wishes.",
        "Ah, Victor, be assured that your cousin and\nplaymate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this\nsupposition.",
        "Be happy, my friend; and if you obey me in this one\nrequest, remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to\ninterrupt my tranquillity.",
        "\u201cDo not let this letter disturb you; do not answer it to-morrow, or the\nnext day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain.",
        "My uncle\nwill send me news of your health; and if I see but one smile on your\nlips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I\nshall need no other happiness.",
        "\u201cELIZABETH LAVENZA.",
        "\u201cGeneva, May 18th, 17\u2014.\u201d\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat\nof the fiend\u2014\u201c_I will be with you on your wedding-night!_\u201d Such was my\nsentence, and on that night would the d\u00e6mon employ every art to destroy\nme, and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to\nconsole my sufferings.",
        "On that night he had determined to consummate his\ncrimes by my death.",
        "Well, be it so; a deadly struggle would then\nassuredly take place, in which if he was victorious, I should be at\npeace, and his power over me be at an end.",
        "If he were vanquished, I\nshould be a free man.",
        "Alas!",
        "what freedom?",
        "such as the peasant enjoys\nwhen his family have been massacred before his eyes, his cottage burnt,\nhis lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless, pennyless, and\nalone, but free.",
        "Such would be my liberty, except that in my Elizabeth I\npossessed a treasure; alas!",
        "balanced by those horrors of remorse and\nguilt, which would pursue me until death.",
        "Sweet and beloved Elizabeth!",
        "I read and re-read her letter, and some\nsoftened feelings stole into my heart, and dared to whisper paradisaical\ndreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the\nangel\u2019s arm bared to drive me from all hope.",
        "Yet I would die to make her\nhappy.",
        "If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,\nagain, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate.",
        "My\ndestruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner; but if my torturer\nshould suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would\nsurely find other, and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge.",
        "He had\nvowed _to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that\nthreat as binding him to peace in the mean time; for, as if to shew me\nthat he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval\nimmediately after the enunciation of his threats.",
        "I resolved, therefore,\nthat if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to her\u2019s\nor my father\u2019s happiness, my adversary\u2019s designs against my life should\nnot retard it a single hour.",
        "In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth.",
        "My letter was calm and\naffectionate.",
        "\u201cI fear, my beloved girl,\u201d I said, \u201clittle happiness\nremains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is concentered\nin you.",
        "Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my\nlife, and my endeavours for contentment.",
        "I have one secret, Elizabeth, a\ndreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with\nhorror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only\nwonder that I survive what I have endured.",
        "I will confide this tale of\nmisery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place;\nfor, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.",
        "But\nuntil then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it.",
        "This I most\nearnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.\u201d\n\nIn about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth\u2019s letter, we returned to\nGeneva.",
        "My cousin welcomed me with warm affection; yet tears were in her\neyes, as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks.",
        "I saw a\nchange in her also.",
        "She was thinner, and had lost much of that heavenly\nvivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness, and soft looks\nof compassion, made her a more fit companion for one blasted and\nmiserable as I was.",
        "The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure.",
        "Memory brought\nmadness with it; and when I thought on what had passed, a real insanity\npossessed me; sometimes I was furious, and burnt with rage, sometimes\nlow and despondent.",
        "I neither spoke or looked, but sat motionless,\nbewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.",
        "Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle\nvoice would soothe me when transported by passion, and inspire me with\nhuman feelings when sunk in torpor.",
        "She wept with me, and for me.",
        "When\nreason returned, she would remonstrate, and endeavour to inspire me with\nresignation.",
        "Ah!",
        "it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for\nthe guilty there is no peace.",
        "The agonies of remorse poison the luxury\nthere is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.",
        "Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with my\ncousin.",
        "I remained silent.",
        "\u201cHave you, then, some other attachment?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone on earth.",
        "I love Elizabeth, and look forward to our union with\ndelight.",
        "Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate\nmyself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear Victor, do not speak thus.",
        "Heavy misfortunes have befallen us;\nbut let us only cling closer to what remains, and transfer our love for\nthose whom we have lost to those who yet live.",
        "Our circle will be small,\nbut bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.",
        "And when\ntime shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will\nbe born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived.\u201d\n\nSuch were the lessons of my father.",
        "But to me the remembrance of the\nthreat returned: nor can you wonder, that, omnipotent as the fiend had\nyet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as\ninvincible; and that when he had pronounced the words, \u201c_I shall be with\nyou on your wedding-night_,\u201d I should regard the threatened fate as\nunavoidable.",
        "But death was no evil to me, if the loss of Elizabeth were\nbalanced with it; and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful\ncountenance, agreed with my father, that if my cousin would consent, the\nceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the\nseal to my fate.",
        "Great God!",
        "if for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish\nintention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself\nfor ever from my native country, and wandered a friendless outcast over\nthe earth, than have consented to this miserable marriage.",
        "But, as if\npossessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real\nintentions; and when I thought that I prepared only my own death, I\nhastened that of a far dearer victim.",
        "As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice\nor a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me.",
        "But I concealed\nmy feelings by an appearance of hilarity, that brought smiles and joy to\nthe countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and\nnicer eye of Elizabeth.",
        "She looked forward to our union with placid\ncontentment, not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes\nhad impressed, that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness,\nmight soon dissipate into an airy dream, and leave no trace but deep and\neverlasting regret.",
        "Preparations were made for the event; congratulatory visits were\nreceived; and all wore a smiling appearance.",
        "I shut up, as well as I\ncould, in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there, and entered with\nseeming earnestness into the plans of my father, although they might\nonly serve as the decorations of my tragedy.",
        "A house was purchased for\nus near Cologny, by which we should enjoy the pleasures of the country,\nand yet be so near Geneva as to see my father every day; who would\nstill reside within the walls, for the benefit of Ernest, that he might\nfollow his studies at the schools.",
        "In the mean time I took every precaution to defend my person, in case\nthe fiend should openly attack me.",
        "I carried pistols and a dagger\nconstantly about me, and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice; and\nby these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity.",
        "Indeed, as the\nperiod approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be\nregarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for\nin my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty, as the day fixed\nfor its solemnization drew nearer, and I heard it continually spoken of\nas an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.",
        "Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to\ncalm her mind.",
        "But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my\ndestiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;\nand perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret, which I had\npromised to reveal to her the following day.",
        "My father was in the mean\ntime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only observed in the\nmelancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.",
        "After the ceremony was performed, a large party assembled at my\nfather\u2019s; but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should pass the\nafternoon and night at Evian, and return to Cologny the next morning.",
        "As\nthe day was fair, and the wind favourable, we resolved to go by water.",
        "Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the\nfeeling of happiness.",
        "We passed rapidly along: the sun was hot, but we\nwere sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy, while we enjoyed the\nbeauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw\nMont Sal\u00eave, the pleasant banks of Montal\u00eagre, and at a distance,\nsurmounting all, the beautiful Mont Bl\u00e2nc, and the assemblage of snowy\nmountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the\nopposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the\nambition that would quit its native country, and an almost\ninsurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.",
        "I took the hand of Elizabeth: \u201cYou are sorrowful, my love.",
        "Ah!",
        "if you\nknew what I have suffered, and what I may yet endure, you would\nendeavour to let me taste the quiet, and freedom from despair, that this\none day at least permits me to enjoy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe happy, my dear Victor,\u201d replied Elizabeth; \u201cthere is, I hope,\nnothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not\npainted in my face, my heart is contented.",
        "Something whispers to me not\nto depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us; but I will\nnot listen to such a sinister voice.",
        "Observe how fast we move along, and\nhow the clouds which sometimes obscure, and sometimes rise above the\ndome of Mont Bl\u00e2nc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting.",
        "Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear\nwaters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom.",
        "What a divine day!",
        "how happy and serene all nature appears!\u201d\n\nThus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all\nreflection upon melancholy subjects.",
        "But her temper was fluctuating; joy\nfor a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place to\ndistraction and reverie.",
        "The sun sunk lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance, and\nobserved its path through the chasms of the higher, and the glens of the\nlower hills.",
        "The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached\nthe amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.",
        "The\nspire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it, and the range\nof mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.",
        "The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,\nsunk at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water,\nand caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore,\nfrom which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay.",
        "The\nsun sunk beneath the horizon as we landed; and as I touched the shore, I\nfelt those cares and fears revive, which soon were to clasp me, and\ncling to me for ever.",
        "CHAPTER VI.",
        "It was eight o\u2019clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the\nshore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn, and\ncontemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured\nin darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.",
        "The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence in\nthe west.",
        "The moon had reached her summit in the heavens, and was\nbeginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight\nof the vulture, and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the scene\nof the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves that\nwere beginning to rise.",
        "Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.",
        "I had been calm during the day; but so soon as night obscured the shapes\nof objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind.",
        "I was anxious and\nwatchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my\nbosom; every sound terrified me; but I resolved that I would sell my\nlife dearly, and not relax the impending conflict until my own life, or\nthat of my adversary, were extinguished.",
        "Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful\nsilence; at length she said, \u201cWhat is it that agitates you, my dear\nVictor?",
        "What is it you fear?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!",
        "peace, peace, my love,\u201d replied I, \u201cthis night, and all will be\nsafe: but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.\u201d\n\nI passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how\ndreadful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,\nand I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until\nI had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.",
        "She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages\nof the house, and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to\nmy adversary.",
        "But I discovered no trace of him, and was beginning to\nconjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the\nexecution of his menaces; when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful\nscream.",
        "It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired.",
        "As I\nheard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the\nmotion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood\ntrickling in my veins, and tingling in the extremities of my limbs.",
        "This\nstate lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed\ninto the room.",
        "Great God!",
        "why did I not then expire!",
        "Why am I here to relate the\ndestruction of the best hope, and the purest creature of earth.",
        "She was\nthere, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging\ndown, and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair.",
        "Every where I turn I see the same figure\u2014her bloodless arms and relaxed\nform flung by the murderer on its bridal bier.",
        "Could I behold this, and\nlive?",
        "Alas!",
        "life is obstinate, and clings closest where it is most\nhated.",
        "For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fainted.",
        "When I recovered, I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn;\ntheir countenances expressed a breathless terror: but the horror of\nothers appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that\noppressed me.",
        "I escaped from them to the room where lay the body of\nElizabeth, my love, my wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy.",
        "She\nhad been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her; and\nnow, as she lay, her head upon her arm, and a handkerchief thrown across\nher face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep.",
        "I rushed towards\nher, and embraced her with ardour; but the deathly languor and coldness\nof the limbs told me, that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be\nthe Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.",
        "The murderous mark of the\nfiend\u2019s grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from\nher lips.",
        "While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look\nup.",
        "The windows of the room had before been darkened; and I felt a kind\nof panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the\nchamber.",
        "The shutters had been thrown back; and, with a sensation of\nhorror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the most\nhideous and abhorred.",
        "A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed\nto jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my\nwife.",
        "I rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom,\nshot; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and, running with the\nswiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake.",
        "The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room.",
        "I pointed to the\nspot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with boats;\nnets were cast, but in vain.",
        "After passing several hours, we returned\nhopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form\nconjured by my fancy.",
        "After having landed, they proceeded to search the\ncountry, parties going in different directions among the woods and\nvines.",
        "I did not accompany them; I was exhausted: a film covered my eyes, and\nmy skin was parched with the heat of fever.",
        "In this state I lay on a\nbed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the\nroom, as if to seek something that I had lost.",
        "At length I remembered that my father would anxiously expect the return\nof Elizabeth and myself, and that I must return alone.",
        "This reflection\nbrought tears into my eyes, and I wept for a long time; but my thoughts\nrambled to various subjects, reflecting on my misfortunes, and their\ncause.",
        "I was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror.",
        "The death of\nWilliam, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly of\nmy wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining friends\nwere safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be\nwrithing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his feet.",
        "This\nidea made me shudder, and recalled me to action.",
        "I started up, and\nresolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.",
        "There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but\nthe wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents.",
        "However, it\nwas hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night.",
        "I\nhired men to row, and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced\nrelief from mental torment in bodily exercise.",
        "But the overflowing\nmisery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured, rendered\nme incapable of any exertion.",
        "I threw down the oar; and, leaning my head\nupon my hands, gave way to every gloomy idea that arose.",
        "If I looked up,\nI saw the scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time, and which\nI had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now\nbut a shadow and a recollection.",
        "Tears streamed from my eyes.",
        "The rain\nhad ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they\nhad done a few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth.",
        "Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.",
        "The sun might shine, or the clouds might lour; but nothing could appear\nto me as it had done the day before.",
        "A fiend had snatched from me every\nhope of future happiness: no creature had ever been so miserable as I\nwas; so frightful an event is single in the history of man.",
        "But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last\noverwhelming event.",
        "Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached\ntheir _acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you.",
        "Know\nthat, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate.",
        "My\nown strength is exhausted; and I must tell, in a few words, what remains\nof my hideous narration.",
        "I arrived at Geneva.",
        "My father and Ernest yet lived; but the former sunk\nunder the tidings that I bore.",
        "I see him now, excellent and venerable\nold man!",
        "his eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and\ntheir delight\u2014his niece, his more than daughter, whom he doated on with\nall that affection which a man feels, who, in the decline of life,\nhaving few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain.",
        "Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs, and\ndoomed him to waste in wretchedness!",
        "He could not live under the horrors\nthat were accumulated around him; an apoplectic fit was brought on, and\nin a few days he died in my arms.",
        "What then became of me?",
        "I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and\ndarkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.",
        "Sometimes, indeed,\nI dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the\nfriends of my youth; but awoke, and found myself in a dungeon.",
        "Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear conception of my\nmiseries and situation, and was then released from my prison.",
        "For they\nhad called me mad; and during many months, as I understood, a solitary\ncell had been my habitation.",
        "But liberty had been a useless gift to me had I not, as I awakened to\nreason, at the same time awakened to revenge.",
        "As the memory of past\nmisfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their cause\u2014the\nmonster whom I had created, the miserable d\u00e6mon whom I had sent abroad\ninto the world for my destruction.",
        "I was possessed by a maddening rage\nwhen I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have\nhim within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed\nhead.",
        "Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to\nreflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a\nmonth after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town, and\ntold him that I had an accusation to make; that I knew the destroyer of\nmy family; and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the\napprehension of the murderer.",
        "The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness: \u201cBe assured,\nsir,\u201d said he, \u201cno pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to\ndiscover the villain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank you,\u201d replied I; \u201clisten, therefore, to the deposition that I\nhave to make.",
        "It is indeed a tale so strange, that I should fear you\nwould not credit it, were there not something in truth which, however\nwonderful, forces conviction.",
        "The story is too connected to be mistaken\nfor a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.\u201d My manner, as I thus\naddressed him, was impressive, but calm; I had formed in my own heart a\nresolution to pursue my destroyer to death; and this purpose quieted my\nagony, and provisionally reconciled me to life.",
        "I now related my history\nbriefly, but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with\naccuracy, and never deviating into invective or exclamation.",
        "The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I\ncontinued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes\nshudder with horror, at others a lively surprise, unmingled with\ndisbelief, was painted on his countenance.",
        "When I had concluded my narration, I said.",
        "\u201cThis is the being whom I\naccuse, and for whose detection and punishment I call upon you to exert\nyour whole power.",
        "It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and\nhope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of\nthose functions on this occasion.\u201d\n\nThis address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my\nauditor.",
        "He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is\ngiven to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was\ncalled upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his\nincredulity returned.",
        "He, however, answered mildly, \u201cI would willingly\nafford you every aid in your pursuit; but the creature of whom you\nspeak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to\ndefiance.",
        "Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice,\nand inhabit caves and dens, where no man would venture to intrude?",
        "Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes,\nand no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered, or what region\nhe may now inhabit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit; and if he\nhas indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois,\nand destroyed as a beast of prey.",
        "But I perceive your thoughts: you do\nnot credit my narrative, and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the\npunishment which is his desert.\u201d\n\nAs I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated;\n\u201cYou are mistaken,\u201d said he, \u201cI will exert myself; and if it is in my\npower to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer punishment\nproportionate to his crimes.",
        "But I fear, from what you have yourself\ndescribed to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable, and\nthat, while every proper measure is pursued, you should endeavour to\nmake up your mind to disappointment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.",
        "My\nrevenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I\nconfess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul.",
        "My rage is\nunspeakable, when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose\nupon society, still exists.",
        "You refuse my just demand: I have but one\nresource; and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his\ndestruction.\u201d\n\nI trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a phrenzy\nin my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness,\nwhich the martyrs of old are said to have possessed.",
        "But to a Genevan\nmagistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of\ndevotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of\nmadness.",
        "He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child, and\nreverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.",
        "\u201cMan,\u201d I cried, \u201chow ignorant art thou in thy pride of wisdom!",
        "Cease;\nyou know not what it is you say.\u201d\n\nI broke from the house angry and disturbed, and retired to meditate on\nsome other mode of action.",
        "CHAPTER VII.",
        "My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was\nswallowed up and lost.",
        "I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone endowed\nme with strength and composure; it modelled my feelings, and allowed me\nto be calculating and calm, at periods when otherwise delirium or death\nwould have been my portion.",
        "My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when\nI was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became\nhateful.",
        "I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few\njewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed.",
        "And now my wanderings began, which are to cease but with life.",
        "I have\ntraversed a vast portion of the earth, and have endured all the\nhardships which travellers, in deserts and barbarous countries, are wont\nto meet.",
        "How I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my\nfailing limbs upon the sandy plain, and prayed for death.",
        "But revenge\nkept me alive; I dared not die, and leave my adversary in being.",
        "When I quitted Geneva, my first labour was to gain some clue by which I\nmight trace the steps of my fiendish enemy.",
        "But my plan was unsettled;\nand I wandered many hours around the confines of the town, uncertain\nwhat path I should pursue.",
        "As night approached, I found myself at the\nentrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father,\nreposed.",
        "I entered it, and approached the tomb which marked their\ngraves.",
        "Every thing was silent, except the leaves of the trees, which\nwere gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark; and the\nscene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested\nobserver.",
        "The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around, and to cast\na shadow, which was felt but seen not, around the head of the mourner.",
        "The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to\nrage and despair.",
        "They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also\nlived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence.",
        "I knelt on\nthe grass, and kissed the earth, and with quivering lips exclaimed, \u201cBy\nthe sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by\nthe deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night,\nand by the spirits that preside over thee, I swear to pursue the d\u00e6mon,\nwho caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict.",
        "For this purpose I will preserve my life: to execute this dear revenge,\nwill I again behold the sun, and tread the green herbage of earth, which\notherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever.",
        "And I call on you,\nspirits of the dead; and on you, wandering ministers of vengeance, to\naid and conduct me in my work.",
        "Let the cursed and hellish monster drink\ndeep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me.\u201d\n\nI had begun my adjuration with solemnity, and an awe which almost\nassured me that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my\ndevotion; but the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choaked\nmy utterance.",
        "I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish\nlaugh.",
        "It rung on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed it,\nand I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.",
        "Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by phrenzy, and have\ndestroyed my miserable existence, but that my vow was heard, and that I\nwas reserved for vengeance.",
        "The laughter died away: when a well-known\nand abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an\naudible whisper\u2014\u201cI am satisfied: miserable wretch!",
        "you have determined\nto live, and I am satisfied.\u201d\n\nI darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded; but the devil\neluded my grasp.",
        "Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose, and shone\nfull upon his ghastly and distorted shape, as he fled with more than\nmortal speed.",
        "I pursued him; and for many months this has been my task.",
        "Guided by a\nslight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly.",
        "The blue\nMediterranean appeared; and, by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter\nby night, and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea.",
        "I took\nmy passage in the same ship; but he escaped, I know not how.",
        "Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I\nhave ever followed in his track.",
        "Sometimes the peasants, scared by this\nhorrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself, who\nfeared that if I lost all trace I should despair and die, often left\nsome mark to guide me.",
        "The snows descended on my head, and I saw the\nprint of his huge step on the white plain.",
        "To you first entering on\nlife, to whom care is new, and agony unknown, how can you understand\nwhat I have felt, and still feel?",
        "Cold, want, and fatigue, were the least\npains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil, and\ncarried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good\nfollowed and directed my steps, and, when I most murmured, would\nsuddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.",
        "Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sunk under the exhaustion, a\nrepast was prepared for me in the desert, that restored and inspirited\nme.",
        "The fare was indeed coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate;\nbut I may not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had\ninvoked to aid me.",
        "Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I\nwas parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the few\ndrops that revived me, and vanish.",
        "I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the d\u00e6mon\ngenerally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the\ncountry chiefly collected.",
        "In other places human beings were seldom\nseen; and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my\npath.",
        "I had money with me, and gained the friendship of the villagers by\ndistributing it, or bringing with me some food that I had killed, which,\nafter taking a small part, I always presented to those who had provided\nme with fire and utensils for cooking.",
        "My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during\nsleep alone that I could taste joy.",
        "O blessed sleep!",
        "often, when most\nmiserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture.",
        "The spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours,\nof happiness, that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage.",
        "Deprived of this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships.",
        "During\nthe day I was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night: for in\nsleep I saw my friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the\nbenevolent countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my\nElizabeth\u2019s voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth.",
        "Often,\nwhen wearied by a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming\nuntil night should come, and that I should then enjoy reality in the\narms of my dearest friends.",
        "What agonizing fondness did I feel for them!",
        "how did I cling to their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my\nwaking hours, and persuade myself that they still lived!",
        "At such\nmoments vengeance, that burned within me, died in my heart, and I\npursued my path towards the destruction of the d\u00e6mon, more as a task\nenjoined by heaven, as the mechanical impulse of some power of which I\nwas unconscious, than as the ardent desire of my soul.",
        "What his feelings were whom I pursued, I cannot know.",
        "Sometimes, indeed,\nhe left marks in writing on the barks of the trees, or cut in stone,\nthat guided me, and instigated my fury.",
        "\u201cMy reign is not yet over,\u201d\n(these words were legible in one of these inscriptions); \u201cyou live, and\nmy power is complete.",
        "Follow me; I seek the everlasting ices of the\nnorth, where you will feel the misery of cold and frost, to which I am\nimpassive.",
        "You will find near this place, if you follow not too tardily,\na dead hare; eat, and be refreshed.",
        "Come on, my enemy; we have yet to\nwrestle for our lives; but many hard and miserable hours must you\nendure, until that period shall arrive.\u201d\n\nScoffing devil!",
        "Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,\nmiserable fiend, to torture and death.",
        "Never will I omit my search,\nuntil he or I perish; and then with what ecstacy shall I join my\nElizabeth, and those who even now prepare for me the reward of my\ntedious toil and horrible pilgrimage.",
        "As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened, and\nthe cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support.",
        "The\npeasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy\nventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from\ntheir hiding places to seek for prey.",
        "The rivers were covered with ice,\nand no fish could be procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief\narticle of maintenance.",
        "The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours.",
        "One\ninscription that he left was in these words: \u201cPrepare!",
        "your toils only\nbegin: wrap yourself in furs, and provide food, for we shall soon enter\nupon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting\nhatred.\u201d\n\nMy courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I\nresolved not to fail in my purpose; and, calling on heaven to support\nme, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until\nthe ocean appeared at a distance, and formed the utmost boundary of the\nhorizon.",
        "Oh!",
        "how unlike it was to the blue seas of the south!",
        "Covered\nwith ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior\nwildness and ruggedness.",
        "The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the\nMediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the\nboundary of their toils.",
        "I did not weep; but I knelt down, and, with a\nfull heart, thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the\nplace where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary\u2019s gibe, to meet and\ngrapple with him.",
        "Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs, and thus\ntraversed the snows with inconceivable speed.",
        "I know not whether the\nfiend possessed the same advantages; but I found that, as before I had\ndaily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him; so much so, that\nwhen I first saw the ocean, he was but one day\u2019s journey in advance, and\nI hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach.",
        "With new\ncourage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched\nhamlet on the seashore.",
        "I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the\nfiend, and gained accurate information.",
        "A gigantic monster, they said,\nhad arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols; putting\nto flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage, through fear of his\nterrific appearance.",
        "He had carried off their store of winter food, and,\nplacing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove\nof trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy\nof the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea\nin a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must\nspeedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice, or frozen by the\neternal frosts.",
        "On hearing this information, I suffered a temporary access of despair.",
        "He had escaped me; and I must commence a destructive and almost endless\njourney across the mountainous ices of the ocean,\u2014amidst cold that few\nof the inhabitants could long endure, and which I, the native of a\ngenial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive.",
        "Yet at the idea\nthat the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance\nreturned, and, like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.",
        "After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered\nround, and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my\njourney.",
        "I exchanged my land sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of the\nfrozen ocean; and, purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I\ndeparted from land.",
        "I cannot guess how many days have passed since then; but I have endured\nmisery, which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution\nburning within my heart could have enabled me to support.",
        "Immense and\nrugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard\nthe thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction.",
        "But\nagain the frost came, and made the paths of the sea secure.",
        "By the quantity of provision which I had consumed I should guess that I\nhad passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction of\nhope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of\ndespondency and grief from my eyes.",
        "Despair had indeed almost secured\nher prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery; when once,\nafter the poor animals that carried me had with incredible toil gained\nthe summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one sinking under his fatigue\ndied, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye\ncaught a dark speck upon the dusky plain.",
        "I strained my sight to\ndiscover what it could be, and uttered a wild cry of ecstacy when I\ndistinguished a sledge, and the distorted proportions of a well-known\nform within.",
        "Oh!",
        "with what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!",
        "warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might\nnot intercept the view I had of the d\u00e6mon; but still my sight was dimmed\nby the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed\nme, I wept aloud.",
        "But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their\ndead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food; and, after an\nhour\u2019s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly\nirksome to me, I continued my route.",
        "The sledge was still visible; nor\ndid I again lose sight of it, except at the moments when for a short\ntime some ice rock concealed it with its intervening crags.",
        "I indeed\nperceptibly gained on it; and when, after nearly two days\u2019 journey, I\nbeheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within\nme.",
        "But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my enemy, my hopes were\nsuddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I\nhad ever done before.",
        "A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its\nprogress, as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every\nmoment more ominous and terrific.",
        "I pressed on, but in vain.",
        "The wind\narose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake,\nit split, and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound.",
        "The work\nwas soon finished: in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me\nand my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice, that\nwas continually lessening, and thus preparing for me a hideous death.",
        "In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died; and\nI myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress, when I\nsaw your vessel riding at anchor, and holding forth to me hopes of\nsuccour and life.",
        "I had no conception that vessels ever came so far\nnorth, and was astounded at the sight.",
        "I quickly destroyed part of my\nsledge to construct oars; and by these means was enabled, with infinite\nfatigue, to move my ice-raft in the direction of your ship.",
        "I had\ndetermined, if you were going southward, still to trust myself to the\nmercy of the seas, rather than abandon my purpose.",
        "I hoped to induce you\nto grant me a boat with which I could still pursue my enemy.",
        "But your\ndirection was northward.",
        "You took me on board when my vigour was\nexhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships\ninto a death, which I still dread,\u2014for my task is unfulfilled.",
        "Oh!",
        "when will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the d\u00e6mon, allow me\nthe rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live?",
        "If I do,\nswear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape; that you will seek him,\nand satisfy my vengeance in his death.",
        "Yet, do I dare ask you to\nundertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?",
        "No; I am not so selfish.",
        "Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear; if\nthe ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he\nshall not live\u2014swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated\nwoes, and live to make another such a wretch as I am.",
        "He is eloquent\nand persuasive; and once his words had even power over my heart: but\ntrust him not.",
        "His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery and\nfiend-like malice.",

        "His tale is connected, and told with an appearance of the simplest\ntruth; yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he\nshewed me, and the apparition of the monster, seen from our ship,\nbrought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than\nhis asseverations, however earnest and connected.",

        "I recollected my threat, and\nresolved that it should be accomplished.",
        "I knew that I was preparing for\nmyself a deadly torture; but I was the slave, not the master of an\nimpulse, which I detested, yet could not disobey.",

        "\u201cWretch!\u201d I said, \u201cit is\nwell that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made.",
        "You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed\nyou sit among the ruins, and lament the fall.",

        "Yet I seek not a fellow-feeling in my misery.",
        "No sympathy may I\never find.",
        "When I first sought it, it was the love of virtue, the\nfeelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being\noverflowed, that I wished to be participated.",
        "But now, that virtue has\nbecome to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into\nbitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy?",
        "I am\ncontent to suffer alone, while my sufferings shall endure: when I die, I\nam well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory.",
        "Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of\nenjoyment.",
        "Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings, who, pardoning my\noutward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was\ncapable of bringing forth.",
        "I was nourished with high thoughts of honour\nand devotion.",
        "But now vice has degraded me beneath the meanest animal.",
        "No crime, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can be found comparable\nto mine.",
        "When I call over the frightful catalogue of my deeds, I cannot\nbelieve that I am he whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and\ntranscendant visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness.",
        "But it\nis even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil.",
        "Yet even that\nenemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am\nquite alone.",
        "\u201cYou, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my\ncrimes and his misfortunes.",
        "But, in the detail which he gave you of\nthem, he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I\nendured, wasting in impotent passions.",
        "For whilst I destroyed his hopes,\nI did not satisfy my own desires.",
        "They were for ever ardent and craving;\nstill I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned.",
        "Was there\nno injustice in this?",
        "Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all\nhuman kind sinned against me?",
        "Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his\nfriend from his door with contumely?",
        "Why do you not execrate the rustic\nwho sought to destroy the saviour of his child?",
        "Nay, these are virtuous\nand immaculate beings!",
        "I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an\nabortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on.",
        "Even now my\nblood boils at the recollection of this injustice.",
        "\u201cBut it is true that I am a wretch.",
        "I have murdered the lovely and the\nhelpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept, and grasped to\ndeath his throat who never injured me or any other living thing.",
        "I have\ndevoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love\nand admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that\nirremediable ruin.",
        "There he lies, white and cold in death.",
        "You hate me;\nbut your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself.",
        "I look\non the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the\nimagination of it was conceived, and long for the moment when they will\nmeet my eyes, when it will haunt my thoughts, no more.",

        "Neither your\u2019s nor any man\u2019s death is needed to\nconsummate the series of my being, and accomplish that which must be\ndone; but it requires my own.",
        "Do not think that I shall be slow to\nperform this sacrifice.",
        "I shall quit your vessel on the ice-raft which\nbrought me hither, and shall seek the most northern extremity of the\nglobe; I shall collect my funeral pile, and consume to ashes this\nmiserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and\nunhallowed wretch, who would create such another as I have been.",
        "I shall\ndie.",
        "I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me, or be the\nprey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched.",
        "He is dead who called me\ninto being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both\nwill speedily vanish.",
        "I shall no longer see the sun or stars, or feel\nthe winds play on my cheeks.",
        "Light, feeling, and sense, will pass away;\nand in this condition must I find my happiness.",
        "Some years ago, when the\nimages which this world affords first opened upon me, when I felt the\ncheering warmth of summer, and heard the rustling of the leaves and the\nchirping of the birds, and these were all to me, I should have wept to\ndie; now it is my only consolation.",
        "Polluted by crimes, and torn by the\nbitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in death?",

        "I leave you, and in you the last of human kind whom these\neyes will ever behold.",
        "Farewell, Frankenstein!",
        "If thou wert yet alive,\nand yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better\nsatiated in my life than in my destruction.",
        "But it was not so; thou\ndidst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;\nand if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hast not yet ceased to\nthink and feel, thou desirest not my life for my own misery.",
        "Blasted as\nthou wert, my agony was still superior to thine; for the bitter sting of\nremorse may not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close\nthem for ever.",

        "Soon these burning miseries will be\nextinct.",
        "I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly, and exult in the\nagony of the torturing flames.",
        "The light of that conflagration will fade\naway; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds.",
        "My spirit will\nsleep in peace; or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.",

        "Having some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the\nBritish Museum, and made search among the books and maps of the library\nregarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of\nthe country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with\na noble of that country.",

        "All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of\nbeauty of every kind.",
        "Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the\ntop of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by\nrivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side\nof them to be subject to great floods.",
        "It takes a lot of water, and\nrunning strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear.",
        "At every\nstation there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts\nof attire.",
        "Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those\nI saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round\nhats and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque.",
        "The\nwomen looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very\nclumsy about the waist.",
        "They had all full white sleeves of some kind or\nother, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something\nfluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course\npetticoats under them.",
        "The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks,\nwho are more barbarian than the rest, with their big cowboy hats, great\nbaggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy\nleather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails.",
        "They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had\nlong black hair and heavy black moustaches.",
        "They are very picturesque,\nbut do not look prepossessing.",
        "On the stage they would be set down at\nonce as some old Oriental band of brigands.",
        "They are, however, I am\ntold, very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion.",
        "It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is\na very interesting old place.",
        "Being practically on the frontier--for\nthe Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy\nexistence, and it certainly shows marks of it.",
        "Fifty years ago a\nseries of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five\nseparate occasions.",
        "At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it\nunderwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties\nof war proper being assisted by famine and disease.",
        "Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I\nfound, to my delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of course I\nwanted to see all I could of the ways of the country.",
        "I was evidently\nexpected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderly\nwoman in the usual peasant dress--white undergarment with long double\napron, front and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for\nmodesty.",
        "When I came close she bowed, and said: \u201cThe Herr Englishman?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cJonathan Harker.\u201d She smiled, and gave some message\nto an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the\ndoor.",
        "He went, but immediately returned with a letter:--\n\n\n\u201c/My Friend/,--Welcome to the Carpathians.",
        "I am anxiously expecting\nyou.",
        "Sleep well to-night.",
        "At three to-morrow the diligence will start\nfor Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you.",
        "At the Borgo Pass my\ncarriage will await you and will bring you to me.",
        "I trust that your\njourney from London has been a happy one, and that you will enjoy your\nstay in my beautiful land.",
        "\u201cYour friend,\n        \u201c/Dracula./\u201d\n\n\n_4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,\ndirecting him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on\nmaking inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and\npretended that he could not understand my German.",
        "This could not be\ntrue, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he\nanswered my questions exactly as if he did.",
        "He and his wife, the old\nlady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort\nof way.",
        "He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and\nthat was all he knew.",
        "When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and\ncould tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed\nthemselves, and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused\nto speak further.",
        "It was so near the time of starting that I had no\ntime to ask any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any\nmeans comforting.",
        "Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in\na very hysterical way:\n\n\u201cMust you go?",
        "Oh!",
        "young Herr, must you go?\u201d She was in such an excited\nstate that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew,\nand mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at\nall.",
        "I was just able to follow her by asking many questions.",
        "When I\ntold her that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important\nbusiness, she asked again:\n\n\u201cDo you know what day it is?\u201d I answered that it was the fourth of May.",
        "She shook her head as she said again:\n\n\u201cOh, yes!",
        "I know that, I know that!",
        "but do you know what day it is?\u201d On\nmy saying that I did not understand, she went on:\n\n\u201cIt is the eve of St.",
        "George\u2019s Day.",
        "Do you not know that to-night, when\nthe clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have\nfull sway?",
        "Do you know where you are going, and what you are going\nto?\u201d She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but\nwithout effect.",
        "Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not\nto go; at least to wait a day or two before starting.",
        "It was all very\nridiculous, but I did not feel comfortable.",
        "However, there was business\nto be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it.",
        "I therefore\ntried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked\nher, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go.",
        "She then rose and\ndried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me.",
        "I did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been\ntaught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet\nit seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in\nsuch a state of mind.",
        "She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she\nput the rosary round my neck, and said, \u201cFor your mother\u2019s sake,\u201d and\nwent out of the room.",
        "I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I\nam waiting for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix\nis still round my neck.",
        "Whether it is the old lady\u2019s fear, or the many\nghostly traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not\nknow, but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual.",
        "If this\nbook should ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye.",
        "Here\ncomes the coach!",
        "_5 May.",
        "The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun\nis high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with\ntrees or hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and\nlittle are mixed.",
        "I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till\nI awake, naturally I write till sleep comes.",
        "There are many odd things\nto put down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well\nbefore I left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly.",
        "I dined on\nwhat they call \u201crobber steak\u201d--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned\nwith red pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the\nsimple style of the London cat\u2019s-meat!",
        "The wine was Golden Mediasch,\nwhich produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not\ndisagreeable.",
        "I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.",
        "When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I\nsaw him talking with the landlady.",
        "They were evidently talking of\nme, for every now and then they looked at me, and some of the people\nwho were sitting on the bench outside the door--which they call by a\nname meaning \u201cword-bearer\u201d--came and listened, and then they looked\nat me, most of them pityingly.",
        "I could hear a lot of words often\nrepeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the\ncrowd; so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked\nthem out.",
        "I must say they were not cheering to me, for amongst them\nwere \u201cOrdog\u201d--Satan, \u201cpokol\u201d--hell, \u201cstregoica\u201d--witch, \u201cvrolok\u201d and\n\u201cvlkoslak\u201d--both of which mean the same thing, one being Slovak and\nthe other Servian for something that is either were-wolf or vampire.",
        "(_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these superstitions.)",
        "When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this\ntime swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross\nand pointed two fingers towards me.",
        "With some difficulty I got a\nfellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at\nfirst, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a\ncharm or guard against the evil eye.",
        "This was not very pleasant for\nme, just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but\nevery one seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic\nthat I could not but be touched.",
        "I shall never forget the last glimpse\nwhich I had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures,\nall crossing themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with\nits background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green\ntubs clustered in the centre of the yard.",
        "Then our driver, whose wide\nlinen drawers covered the whole front of the box-seat--\u201cgotza\u201d they\ncall them--cracked his big whip over his four small horses, which ran\nabreast, and we set off on our journey.",
        "I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of\nthe scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or\nrather languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might\nnot have been able to throw them off so easily.",
        "Before us lay a green\nsloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep\nhills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable\nend to the road.",
        "There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit\nblossom--apple, plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the\ngreen grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals.",
        "In and out\namongst these green hills of what they call here the \u201cMittel Land\u201d ran\nthe road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut\nout by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down\nthe hillsides like tongues of flame.",
        "The road was rugged, but still we\nseemed to fly over it with a feverish haste.",
        "I could not understand\nthen what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing\nno time in reaching Borgo Prund.",
        "I was told that this road is in\nsummer-time excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after\nthe winter snows.",
        "In this respect it is different from the general run\nof roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are\nnot to be kept in too good order.",
        "Of old the Hospadars would not repair\nthem, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring\nin foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at\nloading point.",
        "Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes\nof forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves.",
        "Right\nand left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling upon them\nand bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep\nblue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where\ngrass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and\npointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where\nthe snowy peaks rose grandly.",
        "Here and there seemed mighty rifts in\nthe mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and\nagain the white gleam of falling water.",
        "One of my companions touched\nmy arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty,\nsnow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our\nserpentine way, to be right before us:--\n\n\u201cLook!",
        "Isten szek!\u201d--\u201cGod\u2019s seat!\u201d--and he crossed himself reverently.",
        "As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower\nbehind us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us.",
        "This\nwas emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the\nsunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink.",
        "Here and\nthere we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I\nnoticed that goitre was painfully prevalent.",
        "By the roadside were many\ncrosses, and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves.",
        "Here\nand there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did\nnot even turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender\nof devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world.",
        "There\nwere many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees and\nhere and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white\nstems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves.",
        "Now\nand again we passed a leiterwagon--the ordinary peasant\u2019s cart, with\nits long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of\nthe road.",
        "On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming\npeasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their\ncoloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long\nstaves, with axe at end.",
        "As the evening fell it began to get very cold,\nand the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the\ngloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which\nran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the\nPass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background\nof late-lying snow.",
        "Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine\nwoods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great\nmasses of greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced\na peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts\nand grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling\nsunset threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst\nthe Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys.",
        "Sometimes\nthe hills were so steep that, despite our driver\u2019s haste, the horses\ncould only go slowly.",
        "I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do\nat home, but the driver would not hear of it.",
        "\u201cNo, no,\u201d he said; \u201cyou\nmust not walk here; the dogs are too fierce!\u201d and then he added, with\nwhat he evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to\ncatch the approving smile of the rest--\u201cand you may have enough of such\nmatters before you go to sleep.\u201d The only stop he would make was a\nmoment\u2019s pause to light his lamps.",
        "When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the\npassengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as\nthough urging him to further speed.",
        "He lashed the horses unmercifully\nwith his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on\nto further exertions.",
        "Then through the darkness I could see a sort of\npatch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the\nhills.",
        "The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach\nrocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a\nstormy sea.",
        "I had to hold on.",
        "The road grew more level, and we appeared\nto fly along.",
        "Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each\nside and to frown down upon us; we were entering the Borgo Pass.",
        "One by\none several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed upon\nme with earnestness which would take no denial; these were certainly of\nan odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good faith, with a\nkindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of fear-meaning\nmovements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz--the sign of\nthe cross and the guard against the evil eye.",
        "Then, as we flew along,\nthe driver leaned forward, and on each side the passengers, craning\nover the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness.",
        "It was\nevident that something very exciting was either happening or expected,\nbut though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest\nexplanation.",
        "This state of excitement kept on for some little time;\nand at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern\nside.",
        "There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the\nheavy, oppressive sense of thunder.",
        "It seemed as though the mountain\nrange had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into\nthe thunderous one.",
        "I was now myself looking out for the conveyance\nwhich was to take me to the Count.",
        "Each moment I expected to see the\nglare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark.",
        "The only light\nwas the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which steam from our\nhard-driven horses rose in a white cloud.",
        "We could now see the sandy\nroad lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.",
        "The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock\nmy own disappointment.",
        "I was already thinking what I had best do, when\nthe driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which\nI could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I\nthought it was, \u201cAn hour less than the time.\u201d Then, turning to me, he\nsaid in German worse than my own:--\n\n\u201cThere is no carriage here.",
        "The Herr is not expected, after all.",
        "He\nwill now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day;\nbetter the next day.\u201d Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh\nand snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up.",
        "Then, amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal\ncrossing of themselves, a cal\u00e8che, with four horses, drove up behind\nus, overtook us, and drew up beside the coach.",
        "I could see from the\nflash of our lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were\ncoal-black and splendid animals.",
        "They were driven by a tall man, with a\nlong brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face\nfrom us.",
        "I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes,\nwhich seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us.",
        "He said to the\ndriver:--\n\n\u201cYou are early to-night, my friend.\u201d The man stammered in reply:--\n\n\u201cThe English Herr was in a hurry,\u201d to which the stranger replied:--\n\n\u201cThat is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina.",
        "You\ncannot deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are\nswift.\u201d As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking\nmouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory.",
        "One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger\u2019s\n\u201cLenore:\u201d--\n\n    \u201cDenn die Todten reiten schnell.\u201d--\n    (\u201cFor the dead travel fast.\u201d)\n\nThe strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a\ngleaming smile.",
        "The passenger turned his face away, at the same time\nputting out his two fingers and crossing himself.",
        "\u201cGive me the Herr\u2019s\nluggage,\u201d said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were\nhanded out and put in the cal\u00e8che.",
        "Then I descended from the side of\nthe coach, as the cal\u00e8che was close alongside, the driver helping me\nwith a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must\nhave been prodigious.",
        "Without a word he shook his reins, the horses\nturned, and we swept into the darkness of the Pass.",
        "As I looked back I\nsaw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps,\nand projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing\nthemselves.",
        "Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses,\nand off they swept on their way to Bukovina.",
        "As they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill, and a lonely\nfeeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders, and a\nrug across my knees, and the driver said in excellent German:--\n\n\u201cThe night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take\nall care of you.",
        "There is a flask of slivovitz [the plum brandy of the\ncountry] underneath the seat, if you should require it.\u201d I did not take\nany, but it was a comfort to know it was there, all the same.",
        "I felt a\nlittle strange, and not a little frightened.",
        "I think had there been any\nalternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that unknown\nnight journey.",
        "The carriage went at a hard pace straight along, then we\nmade a complete turn and went along another straight road.",
        "It seemed\nto me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again;\nand so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was so.",
        "I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but\nI really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any\nprotest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention\nto delay.",
        "By and by, however, as I was curious to know how time was\npassing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was\nwithin a few minutes of midnight.",
        "This gave me a sort of shock, for I\nsuppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my\nrecent experiences.",
        "I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.",
        "Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a\nlong, agonised wailing, as if from fear.",
        "The sound was taken up by\nanother dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind\nwhich now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which\nseemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination\ncould grasp it through the gloom of the night.",
        "At the first howl\nthe horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them\nsoothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though\nafter a runaway from sudden fright.",
        "Then, far off in the distance,\nfrom the mountains on each side of us began a louder and sharper\nhowling--that of wolves--which affected both the horses and myself in\nthe same way--for I was minded to jump from the cal\u00e8che and run, whilst\nthey reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use\nall his great strength to keep them from bolting.",
        "In a few minutes,\nhowever, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far\nbecame quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before\nthem.",
        "He petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their\nears, as I have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary\neffect, for under his caresses they became quite manageable again,\nthough they still trembled.",
        "The driver again took his seat, and shaking\nhis reins, started off at a great pace.",
        "This time, after going to the\nfar side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which\nran sharply to the right.",
        "Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over\nthe roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great\nfrowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side.",
        "Though we were in\nshelter, we could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled\nthrough the rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as\nwe swept along.",
        "It grew colder and colder still, and fine powdery snow\nbegan to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a\nwhite blanket.",
        "The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs,\nthough this grew fainter as we went on our way.",
        "The baying of the\nwolves sounded nearer and nearer, as though they were closing round on\nus from every side.",
        "I grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my\nfear; but the driver was not in the least disturbed.",
        "He kept turning\nhis head to left and right, but I could not see anything through the\ndarkness.",
        "Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame.",
        "The\ndriver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses and,\njumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness.",
        "I did not know\nwhat to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but\nwhile I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word\ntook his seat, and we resumed our journey.",
        "I think I must have fallen\nasleep and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated\nendlessly, and now, looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.",
        "Once the flame appeared so near the road that even in the darkness\naround us I could watch the driver\u2019s motions.",
        "He went rapidly to where\nthe blue flame rose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem\nto illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,\nformed them into some device.",
        "Once there appeared a strange optical\neffect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,\nfor I could see its ghostly flicker all the same.",
        "This startled me,\nbut as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived\nme straining through the darkness.",
        "Then for a time there were no blue\nflames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the\nwolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.",
        "At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he\nhad yet done, and during his absence the horses began to tremble worse\nthan ever and to snort and scream with fright.",
        "I could not see any\ncause for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but\njust then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind\nthe jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw\naround us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,\nwith long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair.",
        "They were a hundred times\nmore terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they\nhowled.",
        "For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear.",
        "It is only\nwhen a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can\nunderstand their true import.",
        "All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had\nsome peculiar effect on them.",
        "The horses jumped about and reared, and\nlooked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;\nbut the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side, and they\nhad perforce to remain within it.",
        "I called to the coachman to come, for\nit seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through\nthe ring and to aid his approach.",
        "I shouted and beat the side of the\ncal\u00e8che, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as\nto give him a chance of reaching the trap.",
        "How he came there, I know\nnot, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and\nlooking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway.",
        "As he swept\nhis long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the\nwolves fell back and back further still.",
        "Just then a heavy cloud passed\nacross the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.",
        "When I could see again the driver was climbing into the cal\u00e8che, and\nthe wolves had disappeared.",
        "This was all so strange and uncanny that\na dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move.",
        "The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost\ncomplete darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon.",
        "We kept on\nascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main\nalways ascending.",
        "Suddenly I became conscious of the fact that the\ndriver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a\nvast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,\nand whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit\nsky.",
        "CHAPTER II.",
        "/Jonathan Harker\u2019s Journal/--_continued._\n\n\n_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully\nawake I must have noticed the approach to such a remarkable place.",
        "In\nthe gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several\ndark ways led from it under great round arches it perhaps seemed\nbigger than it really is.",
        "I have not yet been able to see it by\ndaylight.",
        "When the cal\u00e8che stopped the driver jumped down, and held out his hand\nto assist me to alight.",
        "Again I could not but notice his prodigious\nstrength.",
        "His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have\ncrushed mine if he had chosen.",
        "Then he took out my traps, and placed\nthem on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old\nand studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of\nmassive stone.",
        "I could see even in the dim light that the stone was\nmassively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and\nweather.",
        "As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook\nthe reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared\ndown one of the dark openings.",
        "I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do.",
        "Of bell\nor knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark\nwindow openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate.",
        "The\ntime I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon\nme.",
        "What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?",
        "What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked?",
        "Was this\na customary incident in the life of a solicitor\u2019s clerk sent out to\nexplain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner?",
        "Solicitor\u2019s\nclerk!",
        "Mina would not like that.",
        "Solicitor,--for just before leaving\nLondon I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a\nfull-blown solicitor!",
        "I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see\nif I were awake.",
        "It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I\nexpected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with\nthe dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again\nfelt in the morning after a day of overwork.",
        "But my flesh answered the\npinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived.",
        "I was indeed awake\nand among the Carpathians.",
        "All I could do now was to be patient, and to\nwait the coming of the morning.",
        "Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching\nbehind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming\nlight.",
        "Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of\nmassive bolts drawn back.",
        "A key was turned with the loud grating noise\nof long disuse, and the great door swung back.",
        "Within, stood a tall old man, clean-shaven save for a long white\nmoustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck\nof colour about him anywhere.",
        "He held in his hand an antique silver\nlamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,\nthrowing long, quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of\nthe open door.",
        "The old man motioned me in with his right hand with\na courtly gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange\nintonation:--\n\n\u201cWelcome to my house!",
        "Enter freely and of your own will!\u201d He made no\nmotion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his\ngesture of welcome had fixed him into stone.",
        "The instant, however, that\nI had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and\nholding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,\nan effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as\nice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man.",
        "Again he said:--\n\n\u201cWelcome to my house.",
        "Come freely.",
        "Go safely; and leave something of\nthe happiness you bring!\u201d The strength of the handshake was so much\nakin to that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not\nseen, that for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to\nwhom I was speaking; so, to make sure, I said interrogatively:--\n\n\u201cCount Dracula?\u201d He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--\n\n\u201cI am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr.",
        "Harker, to my house.",
        "Come in;\nthe night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.\u201d As he was\nspeaking he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,\ntook my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him.",
        "I\nprotested but he insisted:--\n\n\u201cNay, sir, you are my guest.",
        "It is late, and my people are not\navailable.",
        "Let me see to your comfort myself.\u201d He insisted on carrying\nmy traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and\nalong another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang\nheavily.",
        "At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced\nto see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,\nand on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs flamed and flared.",
        "The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing\nthe room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room\nlit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort.",
        "Passing through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter.",
        "It was a welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and\nwarmed with another log fire, which sent a hollow roar up the wide\nchimney.",
        "The Count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying,\nbefore he closed the door:--\n\n\u201cYou will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your\ntoilet.",
        "I trust you will find all you wish.",
        "When you are ready come\ninto the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.\u201d\n\nThe light and warmth and the Count\u2019s courteous welcome seemed to have\ndissipated all my doubts and fears.",
        "Having then reached my normal\nstate, I discovered that I was half-famished with hunger; so making a\nhasty toilet, I went into the other room.",
        "I found supper already laid out.",
        "My host, who stood on one side of the\ngreat fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of\nhis hand to the table, and said:--\n\n\u201cI pray you, be seated and sup how you please.",
        "You will, I trust,\nexcuse me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do\nnot sup.\u201d\n\nI handed to him the sealed letter which Mr.",
        "Hawkins had entrusted to\nme.",
        "He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he\nhanded it to me to read.",
        "One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill\nof pleasure:--\n\n\u201cI much regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a\nconstant sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for\nsome time to come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient\nsubstitute, one in whom I have every possible confidence.",
        "He is a young\nman, full of energy and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful\ndisposition.",
        "He is discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in\nmy service.",
        "He shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his\nstay, and shall take your instructions in all matters.\u201d\n\nThe Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I\nfell to at once on an excellent roast chicken.",
        "This, with some cheese\nand a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses,\nwas my supper.",
        "During the time I was eating it the Count asked me\nmany questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had\nexperienced.",
        "By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host\u2019s desire had\ndrawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he\noffered me, at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke.",
        "I\nhad now an opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked\nphysiognomy.",
        "His face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the\nthin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead,\nand hair growing scantily round the temples, but profusely elsewhere.",
        "His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with\nbushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion.",
        "The mouth, so\nfar as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather\ncruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over\nthe lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in\na man of his years.",
        "For the rest, his ears were pale and at the tops\nextremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm\nthough thin.",
        "The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.",
        "Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees\nin the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing\nthem now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather\ncoarse--broad, with squat fingers.",
        "Strange to say, there were hairs\nin the centre of the palm.",
        "The nails were long and fine, and cut to\na sharp point.",
        "As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me,\nI could not repress a shudder.",
        "It may have been that his breath was\nrank, but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what\nI would, I could not conceal.",
        "The Count, evidently noticing it, drew\nback; and with a grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet\ndone his protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of\nthe fireplace.",
        "We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards\nthe window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn.",
        "There seemed\na strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard, as if\nfrom down below in the valley, the howling of many wolves.",
        "The Count\u2019s\neyes gleamed, and he said:--\n\n\u201cListen to them--the children of the night.",
        "What music they make!\u201d\nSeeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he\nadded:--\n\n\u201cAh, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of\nthe hunter.\u201d Then he rose and said:--\n\n\u201cBut you must be tired.",
        "Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you\nshall sleep as late as you will.",
        "I have to be away till the afternoon;\nso sleep well and dream well!\u201d and, with a courteous bow, he opened for\nme himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....\n\nI am all in a sea of wonders.",
        "I doubt; I fear; I think strange things\nwhich I dare not confess to my own soul.",
        "God keep me, if only for the\nsake of those dear to me!",
        "_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the\nlast twenty-four hours.",
        "I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my\nown accord.",
        "When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had\nsupped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by\nthe pot being placed on the hearth.",
        "There was a card on the table, on\nwhich was written:--\n\n\u201cI have to be absent for a while.",
        "Do not wait for me.--D.\u201d So I set to\nand enjoyed a hearty meal.",
        "When I had done, I looked for a bell, so\nthat I might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find\none.",
        "There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering\nthe extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me.",
        "The table\nservice is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of\nimmense value.",
        "The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and\nthe hangings of my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics,\nand must have been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are\ncenturies old, though in excellent order.",
        "I saw something like them\nin Hampton Court, but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten.",
        "But still in none of the rooms is there a mirror.",
        "There is not even a\ntoilet glass on my table, and I had to get the little shaving glass\nfrom my bag before I could either shave or brush my hair.",
        "I have not\nyet seen a servant anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except\nfor the howling of wolves.",
        "When I had finished my meal--I do not know\nwhether to call it breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and\nsix o\u2019clock when I had it--I looked about for something to read, for\nI did not like to go about the castle until I had asked the Count\u2019s\npermission.",
        "There was absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper,\nor even writing materials; so I opened another door in the room and\nfound a sort of library.",
        "The door opposite mine I tried, but found it\nlocked.",
        "In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English\nbooks, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and\nnewspapers.",
        "A table in the centre was littered with English magazines\nand newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date.",
        "The books\nwere of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political\neconomy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life\nand customs and manners.",
        "There were even such books of reference as the\nLondon Directory, the \u201cRed\u201d and \u201cBlue\u201d books, Whitaker\u2019s Almanack, the\nArmy and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the\nLaw List.",
        "Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count\nentered.",
        "He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good\nnight\u2019s rest.",
        "Then he went on:--\n\n\u201cI am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that\nwill interest you.",
        "These friends\u201d--and he laid his hand on some of the\nbooks--\u201chave been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever\nsince I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours\nof pleasure.",
        "Through them I have come to know your great England; and\nto know her is to love her.",
        "I long to go through the crowded streets\nof your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of\nhumanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes\nit what it is.",
        "But alas!",
        "as yet I only know your tongue through books.",
        "To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, Count,\u201d I said, \u201cyou know and speak English thoroughly!\u201d He bowed\ngravely.",
        "\u201cI thank you, my friend, for your all too flattering estimate, but yet\nI fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel.",
        "True, I\nknow the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d I said, \u201cyou speak excellently.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot so,\u201d he answered.",
        "\u201cWell I know that, did I move and speak in your\nLondon, none there are who would not know me for a stranger.",
        "That is\nnot enough for me.",
        "Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people\nknow me, and I am master.",
        "But a stranger in a strange land, he is no\none; men know him not--and to know not is to care not for.",
        "I am content\nif I am like the rest, so that no man stops if he sees me, or pause in\nhis speaking if he hear my words, to say, \u2018Ha, ha!",
        "a stranger!\u2019 I have\nbeen so long master that I would be master still--or at least that none\nother should be master of me.",
        "You come to me not alone as agent of my\nfriend Peter Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in\nLondon.",
        "You shall, I trust, rest here with me a while, so that by our\ntalking I may learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell\nme when I make error, even of the smallest, in my speaking.",
        "I am sorry\nthat I had to be away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one\nwho has so many important affairs in hand.\u201d\n\nOf course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might\ncome into that room when I chose.",
        "He answered: \u201cYes, certainly,\u201d and\nadded:--\n\n\u201cYou may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are\nlocked, where of course you will not wish to go.",
        "There is reason that\nall things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with\nmy knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.\u201d I said I was sure\nof this, and then he went on:--\n\n\u201cWe are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England.",
        "Our ways are\nnot your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things.",
        "Nay, from\nwhat you have told me of your experiences already, you know something\nof what strange things here may be.\u201d\n\nThis led to much conversation.",
        "And as it was evident that he wanted to\ntalk, if only for talking\u2019s sake, I asked him many questions regarding\nthings that had already happened to me or come within my notice.",
        "Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by\npretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked\nmost frankly.",
        "Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I\nasked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for\ninstance, why the coachman went to the places where we had seen the\nblue flames.",
        "Was it indeed true that they showed where gold was hidden?",
        "He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain\nnight of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits are\nsupposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place\nwhere treasure has been concealed.",
        "\u201cThat treasure has been hidden,\u201d he\nwent on, \u201cin the region through which you came last night, there can be\nbut little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by\nthe Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk.",
        "Why, there is hardly a foot of\nsoil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,\npatriots or invaders.",
        "In old days there were stirring times, when the\nAustrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out\nto meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited\ntheir coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep\ndestruction on them with their artificial avalanches.",
        "When the invader\nwas triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been\nsheltered in the friendly soil.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how,\u201d said I, \u201ccan it have remained so long undiscovered, when\nthere is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?\u201d\nThe Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,\nsharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--\n\n\u201cBecause your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool!",
        "Those flames\nonly appear on one night.",
        "And on that night no man of this land will,\nif he can help it, stir without his doors.",
        "And, dear sir, even if he\ndid he would not know what to do.",
        "Why, even the peasant that you tell\nme of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in\ndaylight even for his own work.",
        "You would not, I dare be sworn, be able\nto find these places again?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere you are right,\u201d I said.",
        "\u201cI know no more than the dead where even\nto look for them.\u201d Then we drifted into other matters.",
        "\u201cCome,\u201d he said at last, \u201ctell me of London and of the house which you\nhave procured for me.\u201d With an apology for my remissness, I went into\nmy own room to get the papers from my bag.",
        "Whilst I was placing them in\norder I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as\nI passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp\nlit, for it was by this time deep into the dark.",
        "The lamps were also\nlit in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,\nreading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw\u2019s Guide.",
        "When\nI came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him\nI went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts.",
        "He was interested\nin everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its\nsurroundings.",
        "He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the\nsubject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very\nmuch more than I did.",
        "When I remarked this, he answered:--\n\n\u201cWell, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should?",
        "When I go there\nI shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me,\nI fall into my country\u2019s habit of putting your patronymic first--my\nfriend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me.",
        "He\nwill be in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law\nwith my other friend, Peter Hawkins.",
        "So!\u201d\n\nWe went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at\nPurfleet.",
        "When I had told him the facts and got his signature to the\nnecessary papers, and had written a letter with them ready to post to\nMr.",
        "Hawkins, he began to ask me how I had come across so suitable a\nplace.",
        "I read to him the notes which I had made at the time, and which\nI inscribe here:--\n\n\u201cAt Purfleet, on a by-road, I came across just such a place as seemed\nto be required, and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that\nthe place was for sale.",
        "It is surrounded by a high wall, of ancient\nstructure, built of heavy stones, and has not been repaired for a large\nnumber of years.",
        "The closed gates were of heavy old oak and iron, all\neaten with rust.",
        "\u201cThe estate is called Carfax, no doubt a corruption of the old _Quatre\nFace_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points\nof the compass.",
        "It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded\nby the solid stone wall above mentioned.",
        "There are many trees on it,\nwhich make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond\nor small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear\nand flows away in a fair-sized stream.",
        "The house is very large and of\nall periods back, I should say, to medi\u00e6val times, for one part is of\nstone immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily\nbarred with iron.",
        "It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old\nchapel or church.",
        "I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the\ndoor leading to it from the house, but I have taken with my Kodak views\nof it from various points.",
        "The house has been added to, but in a very\nstraggling way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers,\nwhich must be very great.",
        "There are but few houses close at hand, one\nbeing a very large house only recently added to and formed into a\nprivate lunatic asylum.",
        "It is not, however, visible from the grounds.\u201d\n\nWhen I had finished, he said:--\n\n\u201cI am glad that it is old and big.",
        "I myself am of an old family, and\nto live in a new house would kill me.",
        "A house cannot be made habitable\nin a day; and, after all, how few days go to make up a century.",
        "I\nrejoice that there is a chapel of old times.",
        "We Transylvanian nobles\nlove not to think that our bones may be amongst the common dead.",
        "I seek\nnot gaiety nor mirth, not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine\nand sparkling waters which please the young and gay.",
        "I am no longer\nyoung; and my heart, through weary years of mourning over the dead,\nis not attuned to mirth.",
        "Moreover, the walls of my castle are broken;\nthe shadows are many, and the wind breathes cold through the broken\nbattlements and casements.",
        "I love the shade and the shadow, and would\nbe alone with my thoughts when I may.\u201d\n\nSomehow his words and his look did not seem to accord, or else it was\nthat his cast of face made his smile look malignant and saturnine.",
        "Presently, with an excuse, he left me, asking me to put all my papers\ntogether.",
        "He was some little time away, and I began to look at some of\nthe books around me.",
        "One was an atlas, which I found opened naturally\nat England, as if that map had been much used.",
        "On looking at it I\nfound in certain places little rings marked, and on examining these I\nnoticed that one was near London on the east side, manifestly where his\nnew estate was situated; the other two were Exeter, and Whitby on the\nYorkshire coast.",
        "It was the better part of an hour when the Count returned.",
        "\u201cAha!\u201d\nhe said; \u201cstill at your books?",
        "Good!",
        "But you must not work always.",
        "Come; I am informed that your supper is ready.\u201d He took my arm, and\nwe went into the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready\non the table.",
        "The Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on\nhis being away from home.",
        "But he sat as on the previous night, and\nchatted whilst I ate.",
        "After supper I smoked, as on the last evening,\nand the Count stayed with me, chatting and asking questions on every\nconceivable subject, hour after hour.",
        "I felt that it was getting very\nlate indeed, but I did not say anything, for I felt under obligation to\nmeet my host\u2019s wishes in every way.",
        "I was not sleepy, as the long sleep\nyesterday had fortified me; but I could not help experiencing that\nchill which comes over one at the coming of dawn, which is like, in its\nway, the turn of the tide.",
        "They say that people who are near death die\ngenerally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any\none who has, when tired, and tied as it were to his post, experienced\nthis change in the atmosphere can well believe it.",
        "All at once we heard\nthe crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the\nclear morning air; Count Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:--\n\n\u201cWhy, there is the morning again!",
        "How remiss I am to let you stay up so\nlong.",
        "You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of\nEngland less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by\nus,\u201d and, with a courtly bow, he left me.",
        "I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little\nto notice; my window opened into the courtyard; all I could see was\nthe warm grey quickening sky.",
        "So I pulled the curtains again, and have\nwritten of this day.",
        "_8 May._--I began to fear as I wrote in this book that I was getting\ntoo diffuse; but now I am glad that I went into detail from the first,\nfor there is something so strange about this place and all in it that\nI cannot but feel uneasy.",
        "I wish I were safe out of it, or that I had\nnever come.",
        "It may be that this strange night-existence is telling on\nme; but would that that were all!",
        "If there were any one to talk to I\ncould bear it, but there is no one.",
        "I have only the Count to speak\nwith, and he!--I fear I am myself the only living soul within the\nplace.",
        "Let me be prosaic so far as facts can be; it will help me to\nbear up, and imagination must not run riot with me.",
        "If it does I am\nlost.",
        "Let me say at once how I stand--or seem to.",
        "I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could\nnot sleep any more, got up.",
        "I had hung my shaving glass by the window,\nand was just beginning to shave.",
        "Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,\nand heard the Count\u2019s voice saying to me, \u201cGood morning.\u201d I started,\nfor it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the\nglass covered the whole room behind me.",
        "In starting I had cut myself\nslightly, but did not notice it at the moment.",
        "Having answered the\nCount\u2019s salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been\nmistaken.",
        "This time there could be no error, for the man was close to\nme, and I could see him over my shoulder.",
        "But there was no reflection\nof him in the mirror!",
        "The whole room behind me was displayed; but there\nwas no sign of a man in it, except myself.",
        "This was startling, and,\ncoming on the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase\nthat vague feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is\nnear; but at that instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the\nblood was trickling over my chin.",
        "I laid down the razor, turning as I\ndid so half round to look for some sticking plaster.",
        "When the Count saw\nmy face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly\nmade a grab at my throat.",
        "I drew away, and his hand touched the string\nof beads which held the crucifix.",
        "It made an instant change in him, for\nthe fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever\nthere.",
        "\u201cTake care,\u201d he said, \u201ctake care how you cut yourself.",
        "It is more\ndangerous than you think in this country.\u201d Then seizing the shaving\nglass, he went on: \u201cAnd this is the wretched thing that has done the\nmischief.",
        "It is a foul bauble of man\u2019s vanity.",
        "Away with it!\u201d and\nopening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung\nout the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones\nof the courtyard far below.",
        "Then he withdrew without a word.",
        "It is very\nannoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case\nor the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.",
        "When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could\nnot find the Count anywhere.",
        "So I breakfasted alone.",
        "It is strange\nthat as yet I have not seen the Count eat or drink.",
        "He must be a very\npeculiar man!",
        "After breakfast I did a little exploring in the castle.",
        "I went out on the stairs and found a room looking towards the south.",
        "The view was magnificent, and from where I stood there was every\nopportunity of seeing it.",
        "The castle is on the very edge of a terrible\nprecipice.",
        "A stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet\nwithout touching anything!",
        "As far as the eye can reach is a sea of\ngreen tree-tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm.",
        "Here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges\nthrough the forests.",
        "But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view\nI explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and\nbolted.",
        "In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there\nan available exit.",
        "The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!",
        "CHAPTER III.",
        "/Jonathan Harker\u2019s Journal/ (_continued_).",
        "When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over\nme.",
        "I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out\nof every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my\nhelplessness overpowered all other things.",
        "When I look back after a\nfew hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much\nas a rat does in a trap.",
        "When, however, the conviction had come to me\nthat I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done\nanything in my life--and began to think over what was best to be done.",
        "I am thinking still, and as yet have come to no definite conclusion.",
        "Of\none thing only am I certain: that it is no use making my ideas known\nto the Count.",
        "He knows well that I am imprisoned; and as he has done\nit himself, and has doubtless his own motives for it, he would only\ndeceive me if I trusted him fully with the facts.",
        "So far as I can see,\nmy only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself, and\nmy eyes open.",
        "I am, I know, either being deceived, like a baby, by my\nown fears, or else I am in desperate straits; and if the latter be so,\nI need, and shall need, all my brains to get through.",
        "I had hardly come\nto this conclusion when I heard the great door below shut, and knew\nthat the Count had returned.",
        "He did not come at once into the library,\nso I went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed.",
        "This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along thought--that\nthere were no servants in the house.",
        "When later I saw him through the\nchink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining-room,\nI was assured of it; for if he does himself all these menial offices,\nsurely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.",
        "This gave me\na fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it must have been\nthe Count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here.",
        "This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it mean that he could\ncontrol the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand in silence.",
        "How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the coach had some\nterrible fear for me?",
        "What meant the giving of the crucifix, of the\ngarlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash?",
        "Bless that good, good\nwoman who hung the crucifix round my neck!",
        "for it is a comfort and a\nstrength to me whenever I touch it.",
        "It is odd that a thing which I have\nbeen taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time\nof loneliness and trouble be of help.",
        "Is it that there is something in\nthe essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible\nhelp, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort?",
        "Some time, if it\nmay be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about\nit.",
        "In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count Dracula, as\nit may help me to understand.",
        "To-night he may talk of himself, if I\nturn the conversation that way.",
        "I must be very careful, however, not to\nawake his suspicion.",
        "_Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count.",
        "I asked him a few\nquestions on Transylvanian history, and he warmed up to the subject\nwonderfully.",
        "In his speaking of things and people, and especially\nof battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all.",
        "This he\nafterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house\nand name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their\nfate is his fate.",
        "Whenever he spoke of his house he always said \u201cwe,\u201d\nand spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking.",
        "I wish I could\nput down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most\nfascinating.",
        "It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country.",
        "He\ngrew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great\nwhite moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as\nthough he would crush it by main strength.",
        "One thing he said which I\nshall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way the story of\nhis race:--\n\n\u201cWe Szekelys have a right to be proud, for in our veins flows the blood\nof many brave races who fought as the lion fights, for lordship.",
        "Here,\nin the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from\nIceland the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their\nBerserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe,\nay, and of Asia and Africa, too, till the peoples thought that the\nwere-wolves themselves had come.",
        "Here, too, when they came, they found\nthe Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame,\ntill the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those\nold witches, who, expelled from Scythia, had mated with the devils in\nthe desert.",
        "Fools, fools!",
        "What devil or what witch was ever so great\nas Attila, whose blood is in these veins?\u201d He held up his arms.",
        "\u201cIs\nit a wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that\nwhen the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured\nhis thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back?",
        "Is it strange that\nwhen Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he\nfound us here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was\ncompleted there?",
        "And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the\nSzekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us\nfor centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land;\nay, and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as\nthe Turks say, \u2018water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.\u2019 Who more gladly\nthan we throughout the Four Nations received the \u2018bloody sword,\u2019 or at\nits warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King?",
        "When was\nredeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the\nflags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent;\nwho was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube\nand beat the Turk on his own ground?",
        "This was a Dracula indeed!",
        "Woe\nwas it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his\npeople to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them!",
        "Was it\nnot this Dracula, indeed, who inspired that other of his race who in\na later age again and again brought his forces over the great river\ninto Turkey-land; who, when he was beaten back, came again, and again,\nand again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field where\nhis troops were being slaughtered, since he knew that he alone could\nultimately triumph?",
        "They said that he thought only of himself.",
        "Bah!",
        "what good are peasants without a leader?",
        "Where ends the war without\na brain and heart to conduct it?",
        "Again, when, after the battle of\nMohacs, we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were\namongst their leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not\nfree.",
        "Ah, young sir, the Szekelys--and the Dracula as their heart\u2019s\nblood, their brains, and their swords--can boast a record that mushroom\ngrowths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach.",
        "The\nwarlike days are over.",
        "Blood is too precious a thing in these days of\ndishonourable peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale\nthat is told.\u201d\n\nIt was by this time close on morning, and we went to bed.",
        "(_Mem._ this\ndiary seems horribly like the beginning of the \u201cArabian Nights,\u201d for\neverything has to break off at cock-crow--or like the ghost of Hamlet\u2019s\nfather.)",
        "_12 May._--Let me begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified\nby books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt.",
        "I must\nnot confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own\nobservation or my memory of them.",
        "Last evening when the Count came from\nhis room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the\ndoing of certain kinds of business.",
        "I had spent the day wearily over\nbooks, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the\nmatters I had been examined in at Lincoln\u2019s Inn.",
        "There was a certain\nmethod in the Count\u2019s inquires, so I shall try to put them down in\nsequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.",
        "First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors, or more.",
        "I told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not\nbe wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as\nonly one could act at a time, and that to change would be certain to\nmilitate against his interest.",
        "He seemed thoroughly to understand, and\nwent on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one\nman to attend, say, to banking, and another to look after shipping, in\ncase local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking\nsolicitor.",
        "I asked him to explain more fully, so that I might not by\nany chance mislead him, so he said:--\n\n\u201cI shall illustrate.",
        "Your friend and mine, Mr.",
        "Peter Hawkins, from\nunder the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at Exeter, which is far\nfrom London, buys for me through your good self my place at London.",
        "Good!",
        "Now here let me say frankly, lest you should think it strange\nthat I have sought the services of one so far off from London instead\nof some one resident there, that my motive was that no local interest\nmight be served save my wish only; and as one of London resident might,\nperhaps, have some purpose of himself or friend to serve I went thus\nafield to seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest.",
        "Now, suppose I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to\nNewcastle, or Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it\ncould with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?\u201d I\nanswered that certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors\nhad a system of agency one for the other, so that local work could be\ndone locally on instruction from any solicitor, so that the client,\nsimply placing himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes\ncarried out by him without further trouble.",
        "\u201cBut,\u201d said he, \u201cI could be at liberty to direct myself.",
        "Is it not so?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I replied; \u201cand such is often done by men of business, who\ndo not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making\nconsignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of\ndifficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded\nagainst.",
        "I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,\nand he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made\na wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of\nor foresee.",
        "For a man who was never in the country, and who did not\nevidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen\nwere wonderful.",
        "When he had satisfied himself on these points of which\nhe had spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books\navailable, he suddenly stood up and said:--\n\n\u201cHave you written since your first letter to our friend Mr.",
        "Peter\nHawkins, or to any other?\u201d It was with some bitterness in my heart that\nI answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity\nof sending letters to anybody.",
        "\u201cThen write now, my young friend,\u201d he said, laying a heavy hand on my\nshoulder; \u201cwrite to our friend and to any other; and say, if it will\nplease you, that you shall stay with me until a month from now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you wish me to stay so long?\u201d I asked, for my heart grew cold at\nthe thought.",
        "\u201cI desire it much; nay, I will take no refusal.",
        "When your master,\nemployer, what you will, engaged that some one should come on his\nbehalf, it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted.",
        "I\nhave not stinted.",
        "Is it not so?\u201d\n\nWhat could I do but bow acceptance?",
        "It was Mr.",
        "Hawkins\u2019s interest, not\nmine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count\nDracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing\nwhich made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it\nI could have no choice.",
        "The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his\nmastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them,\nbut in his own smooth, resistless way:--\n\n\u201cI pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of\nthings other than business in your letters.",
        "It will doubtless please\nyour friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to\ngetting home to them.",
        "Is it not so?\u201d As he spoke he handed me three\nsheets of notepaper and three envelopes.",
        "They were all of the thinnest\nforeign post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet\nsmile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red under-lip, I\nunderstood as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I\nwrote, for he would be able to read it.",
        "So I determined to write only\nformal notes now, but to write fully to Mr.",
        "Hawkins in secret, and also\nto Mina, for to her I could write in shorthand, which would puzzle\nthe Count, if he did see it.",
        "When I had written my two letters I sat\nquiet, reading a book whilst the Count wrote several notes, referring\nas he wrote them to some books on his table.",
        "Then he took up my two\nand placed them with his own, and put by his writing materials, after\nwhich, the instant the door had closed behind him, I leaned over and\nlooked at the letters, which were face down on the table.",
        "I felt no\ncompunction in doing so, for under the circumstances I felt that I\nshould protect myself in every way I could.",
        "One of the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No.",
        "7, The\nCrescent, Whitby; another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to\nCoutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth,\nbankers, Buda-Pesth.",
        "The second and fourth were unsealed.",
        "I was just\nabout to look at them when I saw the door-handle move.",
        "I sank back in\nmy seat, having just had time to replace the letters as they had been\nand to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter\nin his hand, entered the room.",
        "He took up the letters on the table and\nstamped them carefully, and then, turning to me, said:--\n\n\u201cI trust you will forgive me, but I have much work to do in private\nthis evening.",
        "You will, I hope, find all things as you wish.\u201d At the\ndoor he turned, and after a moment\u2019s pause said:--\n\n\u201cLet me advise you, my dear young friend--nay, let me warn you with\nall seriousness, that should you leave these rooms you will not by any\nchance go to sleep in any other part of the castle.",
        "It is old, and has\nmany memories, and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely.",
        "Be warned!",
        "Should sleep now or ever overcome you, or be like to do,\nthen haste to your own chamber or to these rooms, for your rest will\nthen be safe.",
        "But if you be not careful in this respect, then\u201d----He\nfinished his speech in a gruesome way, for he motioned with his hands\nas if he were washing them.",
        "I quite understood; my only doubt was as to\nwhether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural, horrible\nnet of gloom and mystery which seemed closing round me.",
        "_Later._--I endorse the last words written, but this time there is no\ndoubt in question.",
        "I shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is\nnot.",
        "I have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed--I imagine that\nmy rest is thus freer from dreams; and there it shall remain.",
        "When he left me I went to my room.",
        "After a little while, not hearing\nany sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look\nout towards the south.",
        "There was some sense of freedom in the vast\nexpanse, inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow\ndarkness of the courtyard.",
        "Looking out on this, I felt that I was\nindeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though\nit were of the night.",
        "I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence\ntell on me.",
        "It is destroying my nerve.",
        "I start at my own shadow, and\nam full of all sorts of horrible imaginings.",
        "God knows that there is\nground for any terrible fear in this accursed place!",
        "I looked out over\nthe beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was\nalmost as light as day.",
        "In the soft light the distant hills became\nmelted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness.",
        "The mere beauty seemed to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in\nevery breath I drew.",
        "As I leaned from the window my eye was caught by\nsomething moving a storey below me, and somewhat to my left, where I\nimagined, from the lie of the rooms, that the windows of the Count\u2019s\nown room would look out.",
        "The window at which I stood was tall and deep,\nstone-mullioned, and though weather-worn, was still complete; but it\nwas evidently many a day since the case had been there.",
        "I drew back\nbehind the stonework, and looked carefully out.",
        "What I saw was the Count\u2019s head coming out from the window.",
        "I did not\nsee the face, but I knew the man by the neck and the movement of his\nback and arms.",
        "In any case, I could not mistake the hands which I had\nhad so many opportunities of studying.",
        "I was at first interested and\nsomewhat amused, for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest\nand amuse a man when he is a prisoner.",
        "But my very feelings changed\nto repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from\nthe window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful\nabyss, _face down_, with his cloak spreading out around him like\ngreat wings.",
        "At first I could not believe my eyes.",
        "I thought it was\nsome trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept\nlooking, and it could be no delusion.",
        "I saw the fingers and toes grasp\nthe corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of\nyears, and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards\nwith considerable speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.",
        "What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the\nsemblance of man?",
        "I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering\nme; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am\nencompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....\n\n_15 May._--Once more have I seen the Count go out in his lizard\nfashion.",
        "He moved downwards in a sidelong way, some hundred feet down,\nand a good deal to the left.",
        "He vanished into some hole or window.",
        "When\nhis head had disappeared I leaned out to try and see more, but without\navail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight.",
        "I\nknew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity\nto explore more than I had dared to do as yet.",
        "I went back to the\nroom, and taking a lamp, tried all the doors.",
        "They were all locked\nas I had expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went\ndown the stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally.",
        "I\nfound I could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great\nchains; but the door was locked, and the key was gone!",
        "That key must\nbe in the Count\u2019s room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so\nthat I may get it and escape.",
        "I went on to make a thorough examination\nof the various stairs and passages, and to try the doors that opened\nfrom them.",
        "One or two small rooms near the hall were open, but there\nwas nothing to see in them except old furniture, dusty with age and\nmoth-eaten.",
        "At last, however, I found one door at the top of a stairway\nwhich, though it seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure.",
        "I tried it harder, and found that it was not really locked, but that\nthe resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat,\nand the heavy door rested on the floor.",
        "Here was an opportunity which\nI might not have again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts\nforced it back so that I could enter.",
        "I was now in a wing of the castle\nfurther to the right than the rooms I knew and a story lower down.",
        "From\nthe windows I could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south\nof the castle, the windows of the end room looking out both west and\nsouth.",
        "On the latter side, as well as to the former, there was a great\nprecipice.",
        "The castle was built on the corner of a great rock, so that\non three sides it was quite impregnable, and great windows were placed\nhere where sling, or bow, or culverin could not reach, and consequently\nlight and comfort, impossible to a position which had to be guarded,\nwere secured.",
        "To the west was a great valley, and then, rising far\naway, great jagged mountain fastnesses, rising peak on peak, the sheer\nrock studded with mountain ash and thorn, whose roots clung in cracks\nand crevices and crannies of the stone.",
        "This was evidently the portion\nof the castle occupied in bygone days, for the furniture had more air\nof comfort than any I had seen.",
        "The windows were curtainless, and the\nyellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to\nsee even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over\nall and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth.",
        "My\nlamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I\nwas glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the\nplace which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble.",
        "Still, it was\nbetter than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the\npresence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I\nfound a soft quietude come over me.",
        "Here I am, sitting at a little oak\ntable where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much\nthought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my\ndiary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last.",
        "It\nis nineteenth century up-to-date with a vengeance.",
        "And yet, unless my\nsenses deceive me, the old centuries had, and have powers of their own\nwhich mere \u201cmodernity\u201d cannot kill.",
        "_Later: the Morning of 16 May._--God preserve my sanity, for to this I\nam reduced.",
        "Safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past.",
        "Whilst I live on here there is but one thing to hope for: that I may\nnot go mad, if, indeed, I be not mad already.",
        "If I be sane, then surely\nit is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this\nhateful place the Count is the least dreadful to me; that to him alone\nI can look for safety, even though this be only whilst I can serve his\npurpose.",
        "Great God!",
        "merciful God!",
        "Let me be calm, for out of that way\nlies madness indeed.",
        "I begin to get new lights on certain things which\nhave puzzled me.",
        "Up to now I never quite knew what Shakespeare meant\nwhen he made Hamlet say:--\n\n    \u201cMy tablets!",
        "quick, my tablets!",
        "\u2019Tis meet that I put it down,\u201d etc.,\n\nfor now, feeling as though my own brain was unhinged or as if the shock\nhad come which must end in its undoing, I turn to my diary for repose.",
        "The habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me.",
        "The Count\u2019s mysterious warning frightened me at the time; it frightens\nme more now when I think of it, for in future he has a fearful hold\nupon me.",
        "I shall fear to doubt what he may say!",
        "When I had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book\nand pen in my pocket, I felt sleepy.",
        "The Count\u2019s warning came into my\nmind, but I took a pleasure in disobeying it.",
        "The sense of sleep was\nupon me, and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider.",
        "The\nsoft moonlight soothed, and the wide expanse without gave a sense of\nfreedom which refreshed me.",
        "I determined not to return to-night to the\ngloom-haunted rooms, but to sleep here, where of old ladies had sat and\nsung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for\ntheir menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars.",
        "I drew a great\ncouch out of its place near the corner, so that, as I lay, I could look\nat the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring\nfor the dust, composed myself for sleep.",
        "I suppose I must have fallen asleep; I hope so, but I fear, for all\nthat followed was startlingly real--so real that now, sitting here in\nthe broad, full sunlight of the morning, I cannot in the least believe\nthat it was all sleep.",
        "I was not alone.",
        "The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I\ncame into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,\nmy own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of\ndust.",
        "In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by\ntheir dress and manner.",
        "I thought at the time that I must be dreaming\nwhen I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw\nno shadow on the floor.",
        "They came close to me and looked at me for some\ntime and then whispered together.",
        "Two were dark, and had high aquiline\nnoses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes, that seemed to\nbe almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon.",
        "The other was\nfair, as fair as can be, with great, wavy masses of golden hair and\neyes like pale sapphires.",
        "I seemed somehow to know her face, and to\nknow it in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect\nat the moment how or where.",
        "All three had brilliant white teeth, that\nshone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips.",
        "There was\nsomething about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same\ntime some deadly fear.",
        "I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that\nthey would kiss me with those red lips.",
        "It is not good to note this\ndown, lest some day it should meet Mina\u2019s eyes and cause her pain;\nbut it is the truth.",
        "They whispered together, and then they all three\nlaughed--such a silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound\nnever could have come through the softness of human lips.",
        "It was like\nthe intolerable, tingling sweetness of water-glasses when played on\nby a cunning hand.",
        "The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the\nother two urged her on.",
        "One said:--\n\n\u201cGo on!",
        "You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to\nbegin.\u201d The other added:--\n\n\u201cHe is young and strong; there are kisses for us all.\u201d I lay quiet,\nlooking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation.",
        "The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement\nof her breath upon me.",
        "Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent\nthe same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter\nunderlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.",
        "I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly\nunder the lashes.",
        "The fair girl went on her knees and bent over me,\nfairly gloating.",
        "There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both\nthrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually\nlicked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the\nmoisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped\nthe white sharp teeth.",
        "Lower and lower went her head as the lips went\nbelow the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my\nthroat.",
        "Then she paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her\ntongue as it licked her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath\non my neck.",
        "Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as one\u2019s flesh\ndoes when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer.",
        "I\ncould feel the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the supersensitive\nskin of my throat, and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching\nand pausing there.",
        "I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and\nwaited--waited with beating heart.",
        "But at that instant another sensation swept through me as quick as\nlightning.",
        "I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his\nbeing as if lapped in a storm of fury.",
        "As my eyes opened involuntarily\nI saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with\ngiant\u2019s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the\nwhite teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with\npassion.",
        "But the Count!",
        "Never did I imagine such wrath and fury, even\nin the demons of the pit.",
        "His eyes were positively blazing.",
        "The red\nlight in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind\nthem.",
        "His face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like\ndrawn wires; the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like\na heaving bar of white-hot metal.",
        "With a fierce sweep of his arm, he\nhurled the woman from him, and then motioned to the others, as though\nhe were beating them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I\nhad seen used to the wolves.",
        "In a voice which, though low and almost a\nwhisper, seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room, as\nhe said:--\n\n\u201cHow dare you touch him, any of you?",
        "How dare you cast eyes on him\nwhen I had forbidden it?",
        "Back, I tell you all!",
        "This man belongs to me!",
        "Beware how you meddle with him, or you\u2019ll have to deal with me.\u201d The\nfair girl, with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--\n\n\u201cYou yourself never loved; you never love!\u201d On this the other women\njoined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the\nroom that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure\nof fiends.",
        "Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,\nand said in a soft whisper:--\n\n\u201cYes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past.",
        "Is it\nnot so?",
        "Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him, you shall\nkiss him at your will.",
        "Now go!",
        "go!",
        "I must awaken him, for there is work\nto be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we to have nothing to-night?\u201d said one of them, with a low laugh,\nas she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which\nmoved as though there were some living thing within it.",
        "For answer he\nnodded his head.",
        "One of the women jumped forward and opened it.",
        "If\nmy ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a\nhalf-smothered child.",
        "The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with\nhorror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful\nbag.",
        "There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me\nwithout my noticing.",
        "They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the\nmoonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the\ndim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.",

        "To be sure, there were\ncertain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid\nby in a manner which was not my habit.",
        "My watch was still unwound, and\nI am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to\nbed, and many such details.",
        "But these things are no proof, for they may\nhave been evidences that my mind was not as usual, and, from some cause\nor another, I had certainly been much upset.",
        "I must watch for proof.",
        "Of one thing I am glad: if it was that the Count carried me here and\nundressed me, he must have been hurried in his task, for my pockets are\nintact.",
        "I am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he\nwould not have brooked.",
        "He would have taken or destroyed it.",
        "As I look\nround this room, although it has been to me so full of fear, it is now\na sort of sanctuary, for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful\nwomen, who were--who _are_--waiting to suck my blood.",
        "_18 May._--I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for\nI _must_ know the truth.",
        "When I got to the doorway at the top of the\nstairs, I found it closed.",
        "It had been so forcibly driven against the\njamb that part of the woodwork was splintered.",
        "I could see that the\nbolt of the lock had not been shot, but the door is fastened from the\ninside.",
        "I fear it was no dream, and must act on this surmise.",
        "_19 May._--I am surely in the toils.",
        "Last night the Count asked me\nin the suavest tones to write three letters, one saying that my work\nhere was nearly done and that I should start for home within a few\ndays, another that I was starting on the next morning from the time\nof the letter, and the third that I had left the castle and arrived\nat Bistritz.",
        "I would fain have rebelled, but felt that in the present\nstate of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the Count\nwhilst I am so absolutely in his power; and to refuse would be to\nexcite his suspicion and to arouse his anger.",
        "He knows that I know\ntoo much, and that I must not live, lest I be dangerous to him; my\nonly chance is to prolong my opportunities.",
        "Something may occur which\nwill give me a chance to escape.",
        "I saw in his eyes something of that\ngathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from\nhim.",
        "He explained to me that posts were few and uncertain, and that my\nwriting now would ensure ease of mind to my friends; and he assured\nme with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the later\nletters, which would be held over at Bistritz until due time in case\nchance would admit of my prolonging my stay, that to oppose him would\nhave been to create new suspicion.",
        "I therefore pretended to fall in\nwith his views, and asked him what dates I should put on the letters.",
        "He calculated a minute, and then said:--\n\n\u201cThe first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June\n29.\u201d\n\nI know now the span of my life.",

        "See!\u201d--he must have looked at\nit--\u201cone is from you, and to my friend Peter Hawkins; the other\u201d--here\nhe caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope, and\nthe dark look came into his face, and his eyes blazed wickedly--\u201cthe\nother is a vile thing, an outrage upon friendship and hospitality!",

        "Your pardon, my friend, that\nunknowingly I did break the seal.",
        "Will you not cover it again?\u201d He\nheld out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean\nenvelope.",
        "I could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence.",
        "When\nhe went out of the room I could hear the key turn softly.",
        "A minute\nlater I went over and tried it, and the door was locked.",
        "When, an hour or two after, the Count came quietly into the room, his\ncoming wakened me, for I had gone to sleep on the sofa.",
        "He was very\ncourteous and very cheery in his manner, and seeing that I had been\nsleeping, he said:\n\n\u201cSo, my friend, you are tired?",
        "Get to bed.",
        "There is the surest rest.",
        "I may not have the pleasure to talk to-night, since there are many\nlabours to me; but you will sleep, I pray.\u201d I passed to my room and\nwent to bed, and, strange to say, slept without dreaming.",
        "Despair has\nits own calms.",
        "_31 May._--This morning when I woke I thought I would provide myself\nwith some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket,\nso that I might write in case I should get an opportunity; but again a\nsurprise, again a shock!",

        "The suit in which I had travelled was gone, and also my overcoat and\nrug; I could find no trace of them anywhere.",
        "This looked like some new\nscheme of villainy....\n\n_17 June._--This morning, as I was sitting on the edge of my bed\ncudgelling my brains, I heard without a cracking of whips and pounding\nand scraping of horses\u2019 feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard.",
        "With joy I hurried to the window, and saw drive into the yard two great\nleiter-waggons, each drawn by eight sturdy horses, and at the head of\neach pair a Slovak, with his wide hat, great, nail-studded belt, dirty\nsheepskin, and high boots.",
        "They had also their long staves in hand.",
        "I\nran to the door, intending to descend and try and join them through\nthe main hall, as I thought that way might be opened for them.",
        "Again a\nshock: my door was fastened on the outside.",
        "Then I ran to the window and cried to them.",
        "They looked up at me\nstupidly and pointed, but just then the \u201chetman\u201d of the Szgany came\nout, and seeing them pointing to my window, said something, at which\nthey laughed.",
        "Henceforth, no effort of mine, no piteous cry or agonised\nentreaty, would make them even look at me.",
        "They resolutely turned away.",
        "The leiter-waggons contained great, square boxes, with handles of thick\nrope; these were evidently empty by the ease with which the Slovaks\nhandled them, and by their resonance as they were roughly moved.",
        "When\nthey were all unloaded and backed in a great heap in one corner of the\nyard, the Slovaks were given some money by the Szgany, and spitting on\nit for luck, lazily went each to his horse\u2019s head.",
        "Shortly afterwards I\nheard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance.",
        "_24 June, before morning._--Last night the Count left me early, and\nlocked himself into his own room.",
        "As soon as I dared, I ran up the\nwinding stair, and looked out of the window which opened south.",
        "I\nthought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.",
        "The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle, and are doing work of\nsome kind.",
        "I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away, muffled sound\nas of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be to the end of\nsome ruthless villainy.",
        "I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw\nsomething coming out of the Count\u2019s window.",
        "I drew back and watched\ncarefully, and saw the whole man emerge.",
        "It was a new shock to me\nto find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst\ntravelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I\nhad seen the women take away.",
        "There could be no doubt as to his quest,\nand in my garb, too!",
        "This, then, is his new scheme of evil: that he\nwill allow others to see me, as they think, so that he may both leave\nevidence that I have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own\nletters, and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local\npeople be attributed to me.",
        "It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut\nup here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law\nwhich is even a criminal\u2019s right and consolation.",
        "I thought I would watch for the Count\u2019s return, and for a long time sat\ndoggedly at the window.",
        "Then I began to notice that there were some\nquaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight.",
        "They were\nlike the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered\nin clusters in a nebulous sort of way.",
        "I watched them with a sense\nof soothing, and a sort of calm stole over me.",
        "I leaned back in the\nembrasure in a more comfortable position, so that I could enjoy more\nfully the aerial gambolling.",
        "Something made me start up, a low, piteous howling of dogs somewhere\nfar below in the valley, which was hidden from my sight.",
        "Louder it\nseemed to ring in my ears, and the floating motes of dust to take new\nshapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight.",
        "I felt myself\nstruggling to awake to some call of my instincts; nay, my very soul\nwas struggling, and my half-remembered sensibilities were striving to\nanswer the call.",
        "I was becoming hypnotised!",
        "Quicker and quicker danced\nthe dust, and the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into\nthe mass of gloom beyond.",
        "More and more they gathered till they seemed\nto take dim phantom shapes.",
        "And then I started, broad awake and in full\npossession of my senses, and ran screaming from the place.",
        "The phantom\nshapes, which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams,\nwere those of the three ghostly women to whom I was doomed.",
        "I fled, and\nfelt somewhat safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and\nwhere the lamp was burning brightly.",
        "When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the\nCount\u2019s room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and\nthen there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me.",
        "With\na beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and\ncould do nothing.",
        "I sat down and simply cried.",
        "As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of\na woman.",
        "I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between\nthe bars.",
        "There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her\nhands over her heart as one distressed with running.",
        "She was leaning\nagainst a corner of the gateway.",
        "When she saw my face at the window she\nthrew herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--\n\n\u201cMonster, give me my child!\u201d\n\nShe threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the\nsame words in tones which wrung my heart.",
        "Then she tore her hair\nand beat her breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of\nextravagant emotion.",
        "Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I\ncould not see her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against\nthe door.",
        "Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of\nthe Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper.",
        "His call seemed to\nbe answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves.",
        "Before many\nminutes had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when\nliberated, through the wide entrance into the courtyard.",
        "There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but\nshort.",
        "Before long they streamed away singly, licking their lips.",
        "I could not pity her, for I knew now what had become of her child, and\nshe was better dead.",
        "What shall I do?",
        "What can I do?",
        "How can I escape from this dreadful\nthrall of night and gloom and fear?",
        "_25 June, morning._--No man knows till he has suffered from the night\nhow sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be.",
        "When\nthe sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great\ngateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to\nme as if the dove from the ark had lighted there.",
        "My fear fell from me\nas if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth.",
        "I\nmust take action of some sort while the courage of the day is upon me.",
        "Last night one of my post-dated letters went to post, the first of that\nfatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from\nthe earth.",
        "Let me not think of it.",
        "Action!",
        "It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or\nthreatened, or in some way in danger or in fear.",
        "I have not yet seen\nthe Count in the daylight.",
        "Can it be that he sleeps when others wake,\nthat he may be awake whilst they sleep?",
        "If I could only get into his\nroom!",
        "But there is no possible way.",
        "The door is always locked, no way\nfor me.",
        "Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it.",
        "Where his body has gone\nwhy may not another body go?",
        "I have seen him myself crawl from his\nwindow; why should not I imitate him, and go in by his window?",
        "The\nchances are desperate, but my need is more desperate still.",
        "I shall\nrisk it.",
        "At the worst it can only be death; and a man\u2019s death is not a\ncalf\u2019s, and the dreaded Hereafter may still be open to me.",
        "God help me\nin my task!",
        "Good-bye, Mina, if I fail; good-bye, my faithful friend and\nsecond father; good-bye, all, and last of all Mina!",
        "_Same day, later._--I have made the effort, and, God helping me, have\ncome safely back to this room.",
        "I must put down every detail in order.",
        "I went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south\nside, and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs\nround the building on this side.",
        "The stones were big and roughly cut,\nand the mortar had by process of time been washed away between them.",
        "I took off my boots, and ventured out on the desperate way.",
        "I looked\ndown once, so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth\nwould not overcome me, but after that kept my eyes away from it.",
        "I\nknew pretty well the direction and distance of the Count\u2019s window, and\nmade for it as well as I could, having regard to the opportunities\navailable.",
        "I did not feel dizzy--I suppose I was too excited--and\nthe time seemed ridiculously short till I found myself standing on\nthe windowsill and trying to raise up the sash.",
        "I was filled with\nagitation, however, when I bent down and slid feet foremost in through\nthe window.",
        "Then I looked round for the Count, but, with surprise and\ngladness, made a discovery.",
        "The room was empty!",
        "It was barely furnished\nwith odd things, which seemed to have never been used; the furniture\nwas something the same style as that in the south rooms, and was\ncovered with dust.",
        "I looked for the key, but it was not in the lock,\nand I could not find it anywhere.",
        "The only thing I found was a great\nheap of gold in one corner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and\nAustrian, and Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a\nfilm of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground.",
        "None of it that\nI noticed was less than three hundred years old.",
        "There were also chains\nand ornaments, some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.",
        "At one corner of the room was a heavy door.",
        "I tried it, for, since I\ncould not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which\nwas the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or\nall my efforts would be in vain.",
        "It was open, and led through a stone\npassage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down.",
        "I descended,\nminding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only\nlit by loopholes in the heavy masonry.",
        "At the bottom there was a dark,\ntunnel-like passage, through which came a deathly, sickly odour, the\nodour of old earth newly turned.",
        "As I went through the passage the\nsmell grew closer and heavier.",
        "At last I pulled open a heavy door\nwhich stood ajar, and found myself in an old, ruined chapel, which had\nevidently been used as a graveyard.",
        "The roof was broken, and in two\nplaces were steps leading to vaults, but the ground had recently been\ndug over, and the earth placed in great wooden boxes, manifestly those\nwhich had been brought by the Slovaks.",
        "There was nobody about, and I\nmade search for any further outlet, but there was none.",
        "Then I went\nover every inch of the ground, so as not to lose a chance.",
        "I went down\neven into the vaults, where the dim light struggled, although to do so\nwas dread to my very soul.",
        "Into two of these I went, but saw nothing\nexcept fragments of old coffins and piles of dust; in the third,\nhowever, I made a discovery.",
        "There, in one of the great boxes, of which there were fifty in all, on\na pile of newly dug earth, lay the Count!",
        "He was either dead or asleep,\nI could not say which--for the eyes were open and stony, but without\nthe glassiness of death--and the cheeks had the warmth of life through\nall their pallor, and the lips were as red as ever.",
        "But there was no\nsign of movement, no pulse, no breath, no beating of the heart.",
        "I bent\nover him, and tried to find any sign of life, but in vain.",
        "He could not\nhave lain there long, for the earthy smell would have passed away in\na few hours.",
        "By the side of the box was its cover, pierced with holes\nhere and there.",
        "I thought he might have the keys on him, but when I\nwent to search I saw the dead eyes, and in them, dead though they were,\nsuch a look of hate, though unconscious of me or my presence, that\nI fled from the place, and leaving the Count\u2019s room by the window,\ncrawled again up the castle wall.",
        "Regaining my own chamber, I threw\nmyself panting upon the bed and tried to think....\n\n_29 June._--To-day is the date of my last letter, and the Count has\ntaken steps to prove that it was genuine, for again I saw him leave\nthe castle by the same window, and in my clothes.",
        "As he went down the\nwall, lizard fashion, I wished I had a gun or some lethal weapon, that\nI might destroy him; but I fear that no weapon wrought alone by man\u2019s\nhand would have any effect on him.",
        "I dared not wait to see him return,\nfor I feared to see those weird sisters.",
        "I came back to the library,\nand read there till I fell asleep.",
        "I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can\nlook as he said:--\n\n\u201cTo-morrow, my friend, we must part.",
        "You return to your beautiful\nEngland, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never\nmeet.",
        "Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be\nhere, but all shall be ready for your journey.",
        "In the morning come\nthe Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come\nsome Slovaks.",
        "When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and\nshall bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina\nto Bistritz.",
        "But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle\nDracula.\u201d I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.",
        "Sincerity!",
        "It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in\nconnection with such a monster, so I asked him point-blank:--\n\n\u201cWhy may I not go to-night?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause, dear sir, my coachman and horses are away on a mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I would walk with pleasure.",
        "I want to get away at once.\u201d He\nsmiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was\nsome trick behind his smoothness.",
        "He said:--\n\n\u201cAnd your baggage?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not care about it.",
        "I can send for it some other time.\u201d\n\nThe Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub\nmy eyes, it seemed so real:--\n\n\u201cYou English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit\nis that which rules our _boyars_: \u2018Welcome the coming, speed the\nparting guest.\u2019 Come with me, my dear young friend.",
        "Not an hour shall\nyou wait in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going,\nand that you so suddenly desire it.",
        "Come!\u201d With a stately gravity, he,\nwith the lamp, preceded me down the stairs and along the hall.",
        "Suddenly\nhe stopped.",
        "\u201cHark!\u201d\n\nClose at hand came the howling of many wolves.",
        "It was almost as if the\nsound sprang up at the raising of his hand, just as the music of a\ngreat orchestra seems to leap under the baton of the conductor.",
        "After a\npause of a moment, he proceeded in his stately way, to the door, drew\nback the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw\nit open.",
        "To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked.",
        "Suspiciously I\nlooked all round, but could see no key of any kind.",
        "As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew\nlouder and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their\nblunt-clawed feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door.",
        "I\nknew that to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless.",
        "With\nsuch allies as these at his command, I could do nothing.",
        "But still the\ndoor continued slowly to open, and only the Count\u2019s body stood in the\ngap.",
        "Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and the means\nof my doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation.",
        "There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the\nCount, and as a last chance I cried out:--\n\n\u201cShut the door; I shall wait till morning!\u201d and covered my face with\nmy hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment.",
        "With one sweep of\nhis powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts\nclanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their\nplaces.",
        "In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went\nto my own room.",
        "The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his\nhand to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile\nthat Judas in hell might be proud of.",
        "When I was in my room and about to lie down, I thought I heard a\nwhispering at my door.",
        "I went to it softly and listened.",
        "Unless my ears\ndeceived me, I heard the voice of the Count:--\n\n\u201cBack, back, to your own place!",
        "Your time is not yet come.",
        "Wait.",
        "Have\npatience.",
        "To-morrow night, to-morrow night, is yours!\u201d There was a low,\nsweet ripple of laughter, and in a rage I threw open the door, and saw\nwithout the three terrible women licking their lips.",
        "As I appeared they\nall joined in a horrible laugh, and ran away.",
        "I came back to my room and threw myself on my knees.",
        "Is it then so near\nthe end?",
        "To-morrow!",
        "to-morrow!",
        "Lord, help me, and those to whom I am\ndear!",
        "_30 June, morning._--These may be the last words I ever write in this\ndiary.",
        "I slept till just before the dawn, and when I woke threw myself\non my knees, for I determined that if Death came he should find me\nready.",
        "At last I felt that subtle change in the air and knew that the morning\nhad come.",
        "Then came the welcome cock-crow, and I felt that I was safe.",
        "With a glad heart, I opened my door and ran down the hall.",
        "I had seen\nthat the door was unlocked and now escape was before me.",
        "With hands\nthat trembled with eagerness, I unhooked the chains and drew back the\nmassive bolts.",
        "But the door would not move.",
        "Despair seized me.",
        "I pulled and pulled\nat the door, and shook it till, massive as it was, it rattled in its\ncasement.",
        "I could see the bolt shot.",
        "It had been locked after I left\nthe Count.",
        "Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I\ndetermined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count\u2019s\nroom.",
        "He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of\nevils.",
        "Without a pause I rushed up to the east window and scrambled\ndown the wall, as before, into the Count\u2019s room.",
        "It was empty, but\nthat was as I expected.",
        "I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap\nof gold remained.",
        "I went through the door in the corner and down the\nwinding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel.",
        "I knew now\nwell enough where to find the monster I sought.",
        "The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the\nlid was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in\ntheir places to be hammered home.",
        "I knew I must search the body for\nthe key, so I raised the lid and laid it back against the wall; and\nthen I saw something which filled my very soul with horror.",
        "There lay\nthe Count, but looking as if his youth had been half-renewed, for the\nwhite hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey; the cheeks\nwere fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath; the mouth\nwas redder than ever, for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood, which\ntrickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck.",
        "Even the deep, burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh, for the\nlids and pouches underneath were bloated.",
        "It seemed as if the whole\nawful creature were simply gorged with blood; he lay like a filthy\nleech, exhausted with his repletion.",
        "I shuddered as I bent over to\ntouch him, and every sense in me revolted at the contact; but I had\nto search, or I was lost.",
        "The coming night might see my own body a\nbanquet in a similar way to those horrid three.",
        "I felt all over the\nbody, but no sign could I find of the key.",
        "Then I stopped and looked\nat the Count.",
        "There was a mocking smile on the bloated face which\nseemed to drive me mad.",
        "This was the being I was helping to transfer\nto London, where, perhaps for centuries to come, he might, amongst its\nteeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and create a new and ever\nwidening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless.",
        "The very\nthought drove me mad.",
        "A terrible desire came upon me to rid the world\nof such a monster.",
        "There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a\nshovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting\nit high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face.",
        "But as I\ndid so the head turned, and the eyes fell full upon me, with all their\nblaze of basilisk horror.",
        "The sight seemed to paralyse me, and the\nshovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face, merely making a\ndeep gash above the forehead.",
        "The shovel fell from my hand across the\nbox, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge\nof the lid, which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from my\nsight.",
        "The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face, blood-stained\nand fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the\nnethermost hell.",
        "I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed\non fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me.",
        "As\nI waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices\ncoming closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and\nthe cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count\nhad spoken were coming.",
        "With a last look round and at the box which\ncontained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count\u2019s\nroom, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.",
        "With strained ears I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding of\nthe key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door.",
        "There must have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key\nfor one of the locked doors.",
        "Then there came the sound of many feet\ntramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo.",
        "I turned to run down again towards the vault, where I might find the\nnew entrance; but at that moment there seemed to come a violent puff of\nwind, and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set\nthe dust from the lintels flying.",
        "When I ran to push it open, I found\nthat it was hopelessly fast.",
        "I was again a prisoner, and the net of\ndoom was closing round me more closely.",
        "As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet\nand the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,\nwith their freight of earth.",
        "There is a sound of hammering; it is the\nbox being nailed down.",
        "Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again\nalong the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.",
        "The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there is a grinding of the key\nin the lock; I can hear the key withdrawn; then another door opens and\nshuts; I hear the creaking of lock and bolt.",
        "Hark!",
        "in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels,\nthe crack of whips, and the chorus of the Szgany as they pass into the\ndistance.",

        "Faugh!",
        "Mina is a\nwoman, and there is naught in common.",
        "They are devils of the Pit!",
        "I shall not remain alone with them; I shall try to scale the castle\nwall farther than I have yet attempted.",
        "I shall take some of the gold\nwith me, lest I want it later.",
        "I may find a way from this dreadful\nplace.",
        "And then away for home!",
        "away to the quickest and nearest train!",
        "away\nfrom this cursed spot, from this cursed land, where the devil and his\nchildren still walk with earthly feet!",
        "At least God\u2019s mercy is better than that of these monsters, and the\nprecipice is steep and high.",

        "And then, my dear, before I could say a word he\nbegan pouring out a perfect torrent of love-making, laying his very\nheart and soul at my feet.",

        "He stood up with my two hands in\nhis, and as he looked down into my face--I am afraid I was blushing\nvery much--he said:--\n\n\u201c\u2018Little girl, I hold your hand, and you\u2019ve kissed me, and if these\nthings don\u2019t make us friends nothing ever will.",
        "Thank you for your\nsweet honesty to me, and good-bye.\u2019 He wrung my hand, and taking up\nhis hat, went straight out of the room without looking back, without a\ntear or a quiver or a pause; and I am crying like a baby.",

        "Between the two piers\nthere is a narrow opening into the harbour, which then suddenly widens.",
        "It is nice at high tide; but when the tide is out it shoals away to\nnothing, and there is merely the stream of the Esk, running between\nbanks of sand, with rocks here and there.",

        "He tells me that he is\nnearly a hundred, and that he was a sailor in the Greenland fishing\nfleet when Waterloo was fought.",
        "He is, I am afraid, a very sceptical\nperson, for when I asked him about the bells at sea and the White Lady\nat the abbey he said very brusquely:--\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t fash masel\u2019 about them, miss.",

        "_Whitby._\n\nOne of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been\nexperienced here, with results both strange and unique.",
        "The weather had\nbeen somewhat sultry, but not to any degree uncommon in the month of\nAugust.",
        "Saturday evening was as fine as ever was known, and the great\nbody of holiday-makers set out yesterday for visits to Mulgrave Woods,\nRobin Hood\u2019s Bay, Rig Mill, Runswick, Staithes, and the various trips\nin the neighbourhood of Whitby.",
        "The steamers _Emma_ and _Scarborough_\nmade excursions along the coast, and there was an unusual amount of\n\u201ctripping\u201d both to and from Whitby.",
        "The day was unusually fine till\nthe afternoon, when some of the gossips who frequent the East Cliff\nchurchyard, and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of\nsea visible to the north and east, called attention to a sudden show\nof \u201cmares\u2019-tails\u201d high in the sky to the north-west.",
        "The wind was then\nblowing from the south-west in the mild degree which in barometrical\nlanguage is ranked \u201cNo.",
        "2: light breeze.\u201d The coastguard on duty at once\nmade report, and one old fisherman, who for more than half a century\nhas kept watch on weather signs from the East Cliff, foretold in an\nemphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm.",
        "The approach of sunset was\nso very beautiful, so grand in its masses of splendidly-coloured clouds,\nthat there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the\nold churchyard to enjoy the beauty.",
        "Before the sun dipped below the\nblack mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its\ndownward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour--flame,\npurple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold; with here\nand there masses not large, but seemingly of absolute blackness, in\nall sorts of shapes, as well outlined as colossal silhouettes.",
        "The\nexperience was not lost on the painters, and doubtless some of the\nsketches of the \u201cPrelude to the Great Storm\u201d will grace the R.A.",

        "The wind fell away entirely during the evening, and at midnight there\nwas a dead calm, a sultry heat, and that prevailing intensity which, on\nthe approach of thunder, affects persons of a sensitive nature.",
        "There\nwere but few lights in sight at sea, for even the coasting steamers,\nwhich usually \u201chug\u201d the shore so closely, kept well to seaward, and but\nfew fishing-boats were in sight.",
        "The only sail noticeable was a foreign\nschooner with all sails set, which was seemingly going westwards.",
        "The\nfoolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for\ncomment whilst she remained in sight, and efforts were made to signal\nher to reduce sail in face of her danger.",
        "Before the night shut down she\nwas seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating\nswell of the sea,\n\n    \u201cAs idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.\u201d\n\nShortly before ten o\u2019clock the stillness of the air grew quite\noppressive, and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep\ninland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard, and\nthe band on the pier, with its lively French air, was like a discord\nin the great harmony of nature\u2019s silence.",
        "A little after midnight came\na strange sound from over the sea, and high overhead the air began to\ncarry a strange, faint hollow booming.",
        "Then without warning the tempest broke.",
        "With a rapidity which, at the\ntime, seemed incredible, and even afterwards is impossible to realise,\nthe whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed.",
        "The waves rose in\ngrowing fury, each over-topping its fellow, till in a very few minutes\nthe lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster.",
        "White-crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the\nshelving cliffs; others broke over the piers, and with their spume\nswept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of\neither pier of Whitby Harbour.",
        "The wind roared like thunder, and blew\nwith such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept\ntheir feet, or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions.",
        "It was\nfound necessary to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers,\nor else the fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold.",
        "To add to the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog\ncame drifting inland--white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly\nfashion, so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort\nof imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were\ntouching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death, and\nmany a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea-mist swept by.",
        "At times\nthe mist cleared, and the sea for some distance could be seen in the\nglare of the lightning, which now came thick and fast, followed by such\nsudden peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling\nunder the shock of the footsteps of the storm.",
        "Some of the scenes thus\nrevealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest--the\nsea, running mountains high, threw skywards with each wave mighty\nmasses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl\naway into space; here and there a fishing-boat, with a rag of sail,\nrunning madly for shelter before the blast; now and again the white\nwings of a storm-tossed sea-bird.",
        "On the summit of the East Cliff the\nnew searchlight was ready for experiment, but had not yet been tried.",
        "The officers in charge of it got it into working order, and in the\npauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea.",
        "Once\nor twice its service was most effective, as when a fishing-boat, with\ngunwale under water, rushed into the harbour, able, by the guidance of\nthe sheltering light, to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers.",
        "As each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy\nfrom the mass of people on shore, a shout which for a moment seemed to\ncleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush.",
        "Before long the\nsearchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails\nset, apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the\nevening.",
        "The wind had by this time backed to the east, and there was a\nshudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realised the terrible\ndanger in which she now was.",
        "Between her and the port lay the great\nflat reef on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered,\nand, with the wind blowing from its present quarter, it would be quite\nimpossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour.",
        "It was\nnow nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were so great that in\ntheir troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible, and the\nschooner, with all sails set, was rushing with such speed that, in the\nwords of one old salt, \u201cshe must fetch up somewhere, if it was only in\nhell.\u201d Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any hitherto--a\nmass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all things like a grey\npall, and left available to men only the organ of hearing, for the roar\nof the tempest, and the crash of the thunder, and the booming of the\nmighty bellows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before.",
        "The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across\nthe East Pier, where the shock was expected, and men waited breathless.",
        "The wind suddenly shifted to the north-east, and the remnant of the\nsea-fog melted in the blast; and then, _mirabile dictu_, between the\npiers, leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed, swept\nthe strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and gained\nthe safety of the harbour.",
        "The searchlight followed her, and a shudder\nran through all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a corpse, with\ndrooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the\nship.",
        "No other form could be seen on deck at all.",
        "A great awe came on\nall as they realised that the ship, as if by a miracle, had found the\nharbour, unsteered save by the hand of a dead man!",
        "However, all took\nplace more quickly than it takes to write these words.",
        "The schooner\npaused not, but rushing across the harbour, pitched herself on that\naccumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms\ninto the south-east corner of the pier jutting under the East Cliff,\nknown locally as Tate Hill Pier.",
        "There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up\non the sand heap.",
        "Every spar, rope, and stay was strained, and some of\nthe \u201ctop-hamper\u201d came crashing down.",
        "But, strangest of all, the very\ninstant the shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from\nbelow, as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from\nthe bow on to the sand.",
        "Making straight for the steep cliff, where the\nchurchyard hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some\nof the flat tombstones--\u201cthruff-steans\u201d or \u201cthrough-stones,\u201d as they\ncall them in the Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the\nsustaining cliff has fallen away, it disappeared in the darkness, which\nseemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight.",
        "It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier,\nas all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed\nor were out on the heights above.",
        "Thus the coastguard on duty on the\neastern side of the harbour, who at once ran down to the little pier,\nwas the first to climb on board.",
        "The men working the searchlight, after\nscouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything, then\nturned the light on the derelict and kept it there.",
        "The coastguard ran\naft, and when he came beside the wheel, bent over to examine it and\nrecoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion.",
        "This seemed to\npique the general curiosity, and quite a number of people began to run.",
        "It is a good way round from the West Cliff by the Drawbridge to Tate\nHill Pier, but your correspondent is a fairly good runner, and came well\nahead of the crowd.",
        "When I arrived, however, I found already assembled\non the pier a crowd, whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to\ncome on board.",
        "By the courtesy of the chief boat-man, I was, as your\ncorrespondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group\nwho saw that dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel.",
        "It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for\nnot often can such a sight have been seen.",
        "The man was simply fastened\nby his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel.",
        "Between\nthe inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which\nit was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast\nby the binding cords.",
        "The poor fellow may have been seated at one\ntime, but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through\nthe rudder of the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords\nwith which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone.",
        "Accurate note was\nmade of the state of things, and a doctor--Surgeon J. M. Caffyn, of\n33, East Elliot Place--who came immediately after me, declared, after\nmaking examination, that the man must have been dead for quite two\ndays.",
        "In his pocket was a bottle, carefully corked, empty save for a\nlittle roll of paper, which proved to be the addendum to the log.",
        "The\ncoastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands, fastening the\nknots with his teeth.",
        "The fact that a coastguard was the first on board\nmay save some complications, later on, in the Admiralty Court; for the\ncoastguards cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first\ncivilian entering on a derelict.",
        "Already, however, the legal tongues are\nwagging, and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights\nof the owner are already completely sacrificed, his property being held\nin contravention of the statutes of mortmain, since the tiller, as\nemblemship, if not proof, of delegated possession, is held in a _dead\nhand_.",
        "It is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently\nremoved from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till\ndeath--a steadfastness as noble as that of the young Casabianca--and\nplaced in the mortuary to await inquest.",
        "Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating; the\ncrowds are scattering homewards, and the sky is beginning to redden over\nthe Yorkshire wolds.",
        "I shall send, in time for your next issue, further\ndetails of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into\nharbour in the storm.",
        "_Whitby._\n\n_9 August._--The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the\nstorm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself.",
        "It\nturns out that the schooner is a Russian from Varna, and is called\nthe _Demeter_.",
        "She is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand, with\nonly a small amount of cargo--a number of great wooden boxes filled\nwith mould.",
        "This cargo was consigned to a Whitby solicitor, Mr.",
        "S.\nF. Billington, of 7, The Crescent, who this morning went aboard and\nformally took possession of the goods consigned to him.",
        "The Russian\nconsul, too, acting for the charter-party, took formal possession of\nthe ship, and paid all harbour dues, etc.",
        "Nothing is talked about here\nto-day except the strange coincidence; the officials of the Board of\nTrade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been\nmade with existing regulations.",
        "As the matter is to be a \u201cnine days\u2019\nwonder,\u201d they are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of\nafter complaint.",
        "A good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog\nwhich landed when the ship struck, and more than a few of the members\nof the S.P.C.A., which is very strong in Whitby, have tried to befriend\nthe animal.",
        "To the general disappointment, however, it was not to be\nfound; it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town.",
        "It may be\nthat it was frightened and made its way on to the moors, where it is\nstill hiding in terror.",
        "There are some who look with dread on such a\npossibility, lest later on it should in itself become a danger, for it\nis evidently a fierce brute.",
        "Early this morning a large dog, a half-bred\nmastiff, belonging to a coal merchant close to Tate Hill Pier, was found\ndead in the roadway opposite its master\u2019s yard.",
        "It had been fighting,\nand manifestly had had a savage opponent, for its throat was torn away,\nand its belly slit open as if with a savage claw.",
        "_Later._--By the kindness of the Board of Trade inspector, I have been\npermitted to look over the log-book of the _Demeter_, which was in order\nup to within three days, but contained nothing of special interest\nexcept as to facts of missing men.",
        "The greater interest, however, is\nwith regard to the paper found in the bottle, which was to-day produced\nat the inquest; and a more strange narrative than the two between them\nunfold it has not been my lot to come across.",
        "As there is no motive\nfor concealment, I am permitted to use them, and accordingly send\nyou a rescript, simply omitting technical details of seamanship and\nsupercargo.",

        "The moment it touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and\nfell all into a tremble.",
        "It did not try to get away, but crouched down,\nquivering and cowering, and was in such a pitiable state of terror that\nI tried, though without effect, to comfort it.",

        "When I came in\nview again the cloud had passed, and the moonlight struck so brilliantly\nthat I could see Lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back\nof the seat.",
        "She was quite alone, and there was not a sign of any living\nthing about.",
        "When I bent over her I could see that she was still asleep.",
        "Her lips\nwere parted, and she was breathing--not softly, as usual with her, but\nin long, heavy gasps, as though striving to get her lungs full at every\nbreath.",
        "As I came close, she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled\nthe collar of her nightdress close round her throat.",
        "Whilst she did so\nthere came a little shudder through her, as though she felt the cold.",
        "I\nflung the warm shawl over her, and drew the edges tight round her neck,\nfor I dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air,\nunclad as she was.",
        "I feared to wake her all at once, so, in order to\nhave my hands free that I might help her, I fastened the shawl at her\nthroat with a big safety-pin; but I must have been clumsy in my anxiety\nand pinched or pricked her with it, for by-and-by, when her breathing\nbecame quieter, she put her hand to her throat again and moaned.",
        "When I\nhad her carefully wrapped up I put my shoes on her feet, and then began\nvery gently to wake her.",
        "At first she did not respond; but gradually\nshe became more and more uneasy in her sleep, moaning and sighing\noccasionally.",
        "At last, as time was passing fast, and for many other\nreasons, I wished to get her home at once, I shook her more forcibly,\ntill finally she opened her eyes and awoke.",
        "She did not seem surprised\nto see me, as, of course, she did not realise all at once where she\nwas.",
        "Lucy always wakes prettily, and even at such a time, when her body\nmust have been chilled with cold, and her mind somewhat appalled at\nwaking unclad in a churchyard at night, she did not lose her grace.",
        "She\ntrembled a little, and clung to me; when I told her to come at once with\nme home she rose without a word, with the obedience of a child.",
        "As we\npassed along, the gravel hurt my feet, and Lucy noticed me wince.",
        "She\nstopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes; but I would not.",
        "However, when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard, where there\nwas a puddle of water remaining from the storm, I daubed my feet with\nmud, using each foot in turn on the other, so that as we went home no\none, in case we should meet any one, should notice my bare feet.",
        "Fortune favoured us, and we got home without meeting a soul.",
        "Once we saw\na man, who seemed not quite sober, passing along a street in front of\nus; but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as\nthere are here, steep little closes, or \u201cwynds,\u201d as they call them in\nScotland.",
        "My heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes I thought\nI should faint.",
        "I was filled with anxiety about Lucy, not only for her\nhealth, lest she should suffer from the exposure, but for her reputation\nin case the story should get wind.",
        "When we got in, and had washed our\nfeet, and had said a prayer of thankfulness together, I tucked her into\nbed.",
        "Before falling asleep she asked--even implored--me not to say a\nword to any one, even her mother, about her sleep-walking adventure.",
        "I hesitated at first to promise; but on thinking of the state of her\nmother\u2019s health, and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her,\nand thinking, too, of how such a story might become distorted--nay,\ninfallibly would--in case it should leak out, I thought it wiser to do\nso.",
        "I hope I did right.",
        "I have locked the door, and the key is tied to\nmy wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed.",
        "Lucy is sleeping\nsoundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea....\n\n_Same day, noon._--All goes well.",
        "Lucy slept till I woke her, and seemed\nnot to have even changed her side.",
        "The adventure of the night does not\nseem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she\nlooks better this morning than she has done for weeks.",
        "I was sorry to\nnotice that my clumsiness with the safety-pin hurt her.",
        "Indeed, it might\nhave been serious, for the skin of her throat was pierced.",
        "I must have\npinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are\ntwo little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress\nwas a drop of blood.",
        "When I apologised and was concerned about it, she\nlaughed and petted me, and said she did not even feel it.",
        "Fortunately it\ncannot leave a scar, as it is so tiny.",
        "_Same day, night._--We passed a happy day.",
        "The air was clear, and the\nsun bright and there was a cool breeze.",
        "We took our lunch to Mulgrave\nWoods, Mrs.",
        "Westenra driving by the road and Lucy and I walking by the\ncliff path and joining her at the gate.",
        "I felt a little sad myself,\nfor I could not but feel how _absolutely_ happy it would have been had\nJonathan been with me.",
        "But there!",
        "I must only be patient.",
        "In the evening\nwe strolled in the Casino Terrace, and heard some good music by Spohr\nand Mackenzie, and went to bed early.",
        "Lucy seems more restful than\nshe has been for some time, and fell asleep at once.",
        "I shall lock the\ndoor and secure the key the same as before, though I do not expect any\ntrouble to-night.",
        "_12 August._--My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night\nI was awakened by Lucy trying to get out.",
        "She seemed, even in her\nsleep, to be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went\nback to bed under a sort of protest.",
        "I woke with the dawn, and heard\nthe birds chirping outside of the window.",
        "Lucy woke, too, and, I was\nglad to see, was even better than on the previous morning.",
        "All her old\ngaiety of manner seemed to have come back, and she came and snuggled in\nbeside me, and told me all about Arthur; I told her how anxious I was\nabout Jonathan, and then she tried to comfort me.",
        "Well, she succeeded\nsomewhat, for, though sympathy can\u2019t alter facts, it can help to make\nthem more bearable.",
        "_13 August._--Another quiet day, and to bed with the key on my wrist as\nbefore.",
        "Again I woke in the night, and found Lucy sitting up in bed,\nstill asleep, pointing to the window.",
        "I got up quietly, and pulling\naside the blind, looked out.",
        "It was brilliant moonlight, and the soft\neffect of the light over the sea and sky--merged together in one great,\nsilent mystery--was beautiful beyond words.",
        "Between me and the moonlight\nflitted a great bat, coming and going in great, whirling circles.",
        "Once\nor twice it came quite close, but was, I suppose, frightened at seeing\nme, and flitted away across the harbour towards the Abbey.",
        "When I\ncame back from the window Lucy had lain down again, and was sleeping\npeacefully.",
        "She did not stir again all night.",
        "_14 August._--On the East Cliff, reading and writing all day.",
        "Lucy seems\nto have become as much in love with the spot as I am, and it is hard to\nget her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or\ndinner.",
        "This afternoon she made a funny remark.",
        "We were coming home for\ndinner, and had come to the top of the steps up from the West Pier and\nstopped to look at the view, as we generally do.",
        "The setting sun, low\ndown in the sky, was just dropping behind Kettleness; the red light was\nthrown over on the East Cliff and the old Abbey, and seemed to bathe\neverything in a beautiful rosy glow.",
        "We were silent for a while, and\nsuddenly Lucy murmured as if to herself:--\n\n\u201cHis red eyes again!",
        "They are just the same.\u201d It was such an odd\nexpression, coming _apropos_ of nothing, that it quite startled me.",
        "I\nslewed round a little, so as to see Lucy well without seeming to stare\nat her, and saw that she was in a half-dreamy state, with an odd look\non her face that I could not quite make out; so I said nothing, but\nfollowed her eyes.",
        "She appeared to be looking over at our seat, whereon\nwas a dark figure seated alone.",
        "I was a little startled myself, for it\nseemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning\nflames; but a second look dispelled the illusion.",
        "The red sunlight was\nshining on the windows of St.",
        "Mary\u2019s Church behind our seat, and as\nthe sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and\nreflection to make it appear as if the light moved.",
        "I called Lucy\u2019s\nattention to the peculiar effect, and she became herself with a start,\nbut she looked sad all the same; it may have been that she was thinking\nof that terrible night up there.",
        "We never refer to it; so I said\nnothing, and we went home to dinner.",
        "Lucy had a headache and went early\nto bed.",
        "I saw her asleep, and went out for a little stroll myself; I\nwalked along the cliffs to the westward, and was full of sweet sadness,\nfor I was thinking of Jonathan.",
        "When coming home--it was then bright\nmoonlight, so bright that, though the front of our part of the Crescent\nwas in shadow, everything could be well seen--I threw a glance up at\nour window, and saw Lucy\u2019s head leaning out.",
        "I thought that perhaps she\nwas looking out for me, so I opened my handkerchief and waved it.",
        "She\ndid not notice or make any movement whatever.",
        "Just then, the moonlight\ncrept round an angle of the building, and the light fell on the window.",
        "There distinctly was Lucy with her head lying up against the side of the\nwindow-sill and her eyes shut.",
        "She was fast asleep, and by her, seated\non the window-sill, was something that looked like a good-sized bird.",
        "I was afraid she might get a chill, so I ran upstairs, but as I came\ninto the room she was moving back to her bed, fast asleep, and breathing\nheavily; she was holding her hand to her throat, as though to protect it\nfrom cold.",
        "I did not wake her, but tucked her up warmly; I have taken care that\nthe door is locked and the window securely fastened.",
        "She looks so sweet as she sleeps; but she is paler than is her wont,\nand there is a drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like.",
        "I fear she is fretting about something.",
        "I wish I could find out what it\nis.",
        "_15 August._--Rose later than usual.",
        "Lucy was languid and tired, and\nslept on after we had been called.",
        "We had a happy surprise at breakfast.",
        "Arthur\u2019s father is better, and wants the marriage to come off soon.",
        "Lucy\nis full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once.",
        "Later\non in the day she told me the cause.",
        "She is grieved to lose Lucy as\nher very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to\nprotect her.",
        "Poor dear, sweet lady!",
        "She confided to me that she has got\nher death-warrant.",
        "She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy;\nher doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for\nher heart is weakening.",
        "At any time, even now, a sudden shock would be\nalmost sure to kill her.",
        "Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of\nthe dreadful night of Lucy\u2019s sleep-walking.",
        "_17 August._--No diary for two whole days.",
        "I have not had the heart to\nwrite.",
        "Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness.",
        "No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing weaker, whilst her\nmother\u2019s hours are numbering to a close.",
        "I do not understand Lucy\u2019s\nfading away as she is doing.",
        "She eats well and sleeps well, and enjoys\nthe fresh air; but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading, and\nshe gets weaker and more languid day by day; at night I hear her gasping\nas if for air.",
        "I keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at\nnight, but she gets up and walks about the room, and sits at the open\nwindow.",
        "Last night I found her leaning out when I woke up, and when I\ntried to wake her I could not; she was in a faint.",
        "When I managed to\nrestore her she was as weak as water, and cried silently between long,\npainful struggles for breath.",
        "When I asked her how she came to be at the\nwindow she shook her head and turned away.",
        "I trust her feeling ill may\nnot be from that unlucky prick of the safety-pin.",
        "I looked at her throat\njust now as she lay asleep, and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed.",
        "They are still open, and, if anything, larger, than before, and the\nedges of them are faintly white.",
        "They are like little white dots with\nred centres.",
        "Unless they heal within a day or two, I shall insist on the\ndoctor seeing about them.",

        "He became quite quiet, and went and sat on the edge of his\nbed resignedly, and looked into space with lack-lustre eyes.",
        "I thought\nI would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed, and tried to\nlead him to talk of his pets, a theme which never failed to excite his\nattention.",

        "To this he answered\nenigmatically:--\n\n\u201cThe bride-maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride;\nbut when the bride draweth nigh, then the maidens shine not to the eyes\nthat are filled.\u201d\n\nHe would not explain himself, but remained obstinately seated on his bed\nall the time I remained with him.",

        "He said he had seen him not ten minutes before, seemingly asleep in his\nbed, when he had looked through the observation-trap in the door.",
        "His\nattention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out.",
        "He\nran back and saw his feet disappear through the window, and had at once\nsent up for me.",
        "He was only in his night-gear, and cannot be far off.",
        "The attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should\ngo than to follow him, as he might lose sight of him whilst getting\nout of the building by the door.",
        "He is a bulky man, and couldn\u2019t get\nthrough the window.",
        "I am thin, so, with his aid, I got out, but feet\nforemost, and, as we were only a few feet above ground, landed unhurt.",
        "The attendant told me the patient had gone to the left and had taken a\nstraight line, so I ran as quickly as I could.",
        "As I got through the belt\nof trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our\ngrounds from those of the deserted house.",
        "I ran back at once, and told the watchman to get three or four men\nimmediately and follow me into the grounds of Carfax, in case our\nfriend might be dangerous.",
        "I got a ladder myself, and crossing the\nwall, dropped down on the other side.",
        "I could see Renfield\u2019s figure\njust disappearing behind the angle of the house, so I ran after him.",
        "On the far side of the house I found him pressed close against the old\niron-bound oak door of the chapel.",
        "He was talking, apparently to some\none, but I was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying, lest\nI might frighten him, and he should run off.",
        "Chasing an errant swarm of\nbees is nothing to following a naked lunatic when the fit of escaping is\nupon him!",
        "After a few minutes, however, I could see that he did not take\nnote of anything around him, and so ventured to draw nearer to him--the\nmore so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in.",

        "I am Your slave, and You will\nreward me, for I shall be faithful.",
        "I have worshipped You long and afar\noff.",
        "Now that You are near, I await Your commands, and You will not pass\nme by, will You, dear Master, in Your distribution of good things?\u201d\n\nHe _is_ a selfish old beggar anyhow.",
        "He thinks of the loaves and fishes\neven when he believes he is in a Real Presence.",
        "His manias make a\nstartling combination.",
        "When we closed in on him he fought like a tiger.",
        "He is immensely strong, and he was more like a wild beast than a man.",
        "I never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before; and I hope I\nshall not again.",

        "His cries are at times awful, but the silences that follow are\nmore deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.",
        "Just now he spoke coherent words for the first time:--\n\n\u201cI shall be patient, Master.",
        "It is coming--coming--coming!\u201d\n\nSo I took the hint, and came too.",

        "Well, my dear, I got to Hull\nall right, and caught the boat to Hamburg, and then the train on here.",
        "I\nfeel I can hardly recall anything of the journey, except that I knew I\nwas coming to Jonathan, and, that as I should have to do some nursing,\nI had better get all the sleep I could.... I found my dear one, oh,\nso thin and pale and weak-looking.",
        "All the resolution has gone out of\nhis dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his face\nhas vanished.",
        "He is only a wreck of himself, and he does not remember\nanything that has happened to him for a long time past.",
        "At least, he\nwants me to believe so, and I shall never ask.",
        "He has had some terrible\nshock, and I fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try to\nrecall it.",
        "Sister Agatha, who is a good creature and a born nurse,\ntells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head.",
        "I\nwanted her to tell me what they were; but she would only cross herself,\nand say she would never tell; that the ravings of the sick were the\nsecrets of God, and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear\nthem, she should respect her trust.",
        "She is a sweet, good soul, and the\nnext day, when she saw I was troubled, she opened up the subject again,\nand after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved\nabout, added: \u2018I can tell you this much, my dear: that it was not about\nanything which he has done wrong himself; and you, as his wife to be,\nhave no cause to be concerned.",
        "He has not forgotten you or what he owes\nto you.",
        "His fear was of great and terrible things, which no mortal can\ntreat of.\u2019 I do believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my\npoor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl.",
        "The idea of\n_my_ being jealous about Jonathan!",
        "And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I\nfelt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a\ncause of trouble.",
        "I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his\nface while he sleeps.",
        "He is waking!",
        "... When he woke he asked me for\nhis coat, as he wanted to get something from the pocket; I asked Sister\nAgatha, and she brought all his things.",
        "I saw that amongst them was his\nnote-book, and was going to ask him to let me look at it--for I knew\nthen that I might find some clue to his trouble--but I suppose he must\nhave seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent me over to the window, saying\nhe wanted to be quite alone for a moment.",
        "Then he called me back, and\nwhen I came he had his hand over the note-book, and he said to me very\nsolemnly:--\n\n\u201c\u2018Wilhelmina\u2019--I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has\nnever called me by that name since he asked me to marry him--\u2018you know,\ndear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be\nno secret, no concealment.",
        "I have had a great shock, and when I try to\nthink of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it\nwas all real or the dreaming of a madman.",
        "You know I have had brain\nfever, and that is to be mad.",

        "Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me\nknow; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to\nthe bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.\u2019 He fell\nback, exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him.",
        "I\nhave asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this\nafternoon, and am waiting her reply....\n\n\u201cShe has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission\nchurch has been sent for.",

        "Then I kissed it\nand showed it to my husband, and told him that I would keep it so, and\nthen it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that\nwe trusted each other; that I would never open it unless it were for his\nown dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty.",
        "Then he took my hand\nin his, and oh, Lucy, it was the first time he took _his wife\u2019s_ hand,\nand said that it was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that\nhe would go through all the past again to win it, if need be.",
        "The poor\ndear meant to have said a part of the past; but he cannot think of time\nyet, and I shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month,\nbut the year.",
        "\u201cWell, my dear, what could I say?",
        "I could only tell him that I was the\nhappiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him\nexcept myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love\nand duty for all the days of my life.",
        "And, my dear, when he kissed me,\nand drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn\npledge between us....\n\n\u201cLucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this?",
        "It is not only because\nit is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear\nto me.",

        "We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful,\nwe got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness\namongst us.",
        "Then Mrs.",

        "We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,\nfor the servants were coming and going.",
        "As soon as the door was closed,\nhowever, the mask fell from her face, and she sank down into a chair\nwith a great sigh, and hid her eyes with her hand.",
        "When I saw that her\nhigh spirits had failed, I at once took advantage of her reaction to\nmake a diagnosis.",
        "She said to me very sweetly:--\n\n\u201c\u2018I cannot tell you how I loathe talking about myself.\u2019 I reminded her\nthat a doctor\u2019s confidence was sacred, but that you were grievously\nanxious about her.",

        "\u201cI could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless, but I could not\nsee the usual an\u00e6mic signs, and by a chance I was actually able to\ntest the quality of her blood, for in opening a window which was stiff\na cord gave way, and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass.",
        "It\nwas a slight matter in itself, but it gave me an evident chance, and I\nsecured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them.",
        "The qualitative\nanalysis gives a quite normal condition, and shows, I should infer, in\nitself a vigorous state of health.",
        "In other physical matters I was quite\nsatisfied that there is no need for anxiety; but as there must be a\ncause somewhere, I have come to the conclusion that it must be something\nmental.",
        "She complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at\ntimes, and of heavy, lethargic sleep, with dreams that frighten her,\nbut regarding which she can remember nothing.",
        "She says that as a child\nshe used to walk in her sleep, and that when in Whitby the habit came\nback, and that once she walked out in the night and went to the East\nCliff, where Miss Murray found her; but she assures me that of late the\nhabit has not returned.",

        "This, with\nan iron nerve, a temper of the ice-brook, an indomitable resolution,\nself-command and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings, and\nthe kindest and truest heart that beats--these form his equipment for\nthe noble work that he is doing for mankind--work both in theory and\npractice, for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy.",

        "I believe Van Helsing saw it, too, for I saw the quick\nlook under his bushy brows that I knew of old.",
        "Then he began to chat\nof all things except ourselves and diseases, and with such an infinite\ngeniality that I could see poor Lucy\u2019s pretence of animation merge into\nreality.",
        "Then, without any seeming change, he brought the conversation\ngently round to his visit, and suavely said:--\n\n\u201c\u2018My dear young miss, I have the so great pleasure because you are much\nbeloved.",

        "So, my dear, we will send\nhim away to smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have\nlittle talk all to ourselves.\u2019 I took the hint, and strolled about,\nand presently the Professor came to the window and called me in.",
        "He\nlooked grave, but said: \u2018I have made careful examination, but there is\nno functional cause.",

        "The attendant\nknew the symptoms, and at once summoned aid.",
        "Fortunately the men came\nat a run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became\nso violent that it took all their strength to hold him.",
        "In about five\nminutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank\ninto a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now.",
        "The attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were\nreally appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some\nof the other patients who were frightened by him.",
        "Indeed, I can quite\nunderstand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was\nsome distance away.",
        "It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum,\nand as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,\nwoe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show\nsomething directly.",

        "He was catching flies and eating them, and was keeping note of his\ncapture by making nail-marks on the edge of the door between the ridges\nof padding.",
        "When he saw me, he came over and apologised for his bad\nconduct, and asked me in a very humble, cringing way to be let back\nto his own room and to have his note-book again.",
        "I thought it well to\nhumour him; so he is back in his room, with the window open.",
        "He has the\nsugar of his tea spread out on the windowsill, and is reaping quite a\nharvest of flies.",
        "He is not now eating them, but putting them in a box,\nas of old, and is already examining the corners of his room to find a\nspider.",
        "I tried to get him to talk about the past few days, for any clue\nof his thoughts would be of immense help to me; but he would not rise.",
        "For a moment or two he looked very sad, and said in a sort of far-away\nvoice, as though saying it rather to himself than to me:--\n\n\u201cAll over!",
        "all over!",
        "He has deserted me.",
        "No hope for me now unless I do\nit for myself!\u201d Then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way, he said:\n\u201cDoctor, won\u2019t you be very good to me and let me have a little more\nsugar?",
        "I think it would be good for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the flies?\u201d I said.",

        "As his room is on this side of the house, I could hear it better than\nin the morning.",
        "It was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky\nbeauty of a sunset over London, with its lurid lights and inky shadows\nand all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul\nwater, and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone\nbuilding, with its wealth of breathing misery, and my own desolate heart\nto endure it all.",
        "I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from\nhis window saw the red disc sink.",
        "As it sank he became less and less\nfrenzied; and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him, an\ninert mass, on the floor.",
        "It is wonderful, however, what intellectual\nrecuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up\nquite calmly and looked around him.",
        "I signalled to the attendants not to\nhold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do.",
        "He went straight\nover to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his\nfly-box and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut the\nwindow, and crossing over, sat down on his bed.",

        "But you do not find the\ngood husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow; that is for\nthe children who play at husbandry, and not for those who take it as of\nthe work of their life.",
        "See you now, friend John?",
        "I have sown my corn,\nand Nature has her work to do in making it sprout; if he sprout at all,\nthere\u2019s some promise; and I wait till the ear begins to swell.\u201d He broke\noff, for he evidently saw that I understood.",
        "Then he went on, and very\ngravely:--\n\n\u201cYou were always a careful student, and your case-book was ever more\nfull than the rest.",

        "I am prepared.\u201d\n\nI went downstairs with him and as we were going there was a knock at the\nhall-door.",
        "When we reached the hall the maid had just opened the door,\nand Arthur was stepping quickly in.",
        "He rushed up to me, saying in an\neager whisper:--\n\n\u201cJack, I was so anxious.",
        "I read between the lines of your letter, and\nhave been in an agony.",
        "The dad was better, so I ran down here to see for\nmyself.",
        "Is not that gentleman Dr.",
        "Van Helsing?",
        "I am so thankful to you,\nsir, for coming.\u201d When first the Professor\u2019s eye had lit upon him he had\nbeen angry at any interruption at such a time; but now, as he took in\nhis stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which\nseemed to emanate from him, his eyes gleamed.",
        "Without a pause he said to\nhim gravely as he held out his hand:--\n\n\u201cSir, you have come in time.",
        "You are the lover of our dear miss.",
        "She\nis bad, very, very bad.",
        "Nay, my child, do not go like that.\u201d For he\nsuddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting.",
        "\u201cYou are to\nhelp her.",
        "You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your\nbest help.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d asked Arthur hoarsely.",
        "\u201cTell me, and I shall do it.",
        "My\nlife is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for\nher.\u201d The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old\nknowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--\n\n\u201cMy young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d There was fire in his eyes, and his open nostrils\nquivered with intent.",
        "Van Helsing slapped him on the shoulder.",
        "\u201cCome!\u201d\nhe said.",
        "\u201cYou are a man, and it is a man we want.",
        "You are better than\nme, better than my friend John.\u201d Arthur looked bewildered, and the\nProfessor went on by explaining in a kindly way:--\n\n\u201cYoung miss is bad, very bad.",
        "She wants blood, and blood she must have\nor die.",
        "My friend John and I have consulted; and we are about to perform\nwhat we call transfusion of blood--to transfer from full veins of one to\nthe empty veins which pine for him.",
        "John was to give his blood, as he is\nthe more young and strong than me\u201d--here Arthur took my hand and wrung\nit hard in silence--\u201cbut, now you are here, you are more good than us,\nold or young, who toil much in the world of thought.",
        "Our nerves are not\nso calm and our blood not so bright than yours!\u201d Arthur turned to him\nand said:--\n\n\u201cIf you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would\nunderstand----\u201d\n\nHe stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.",
        "\u201cGood boy!\u201d said Van Helsing.",
        "\u201cIn the not-so-far-off you will be happy\nthat you have done all for her you love.",
        "Come now and be silent.",
        "You\nshall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you\nmust leave at my sign.",
        "Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with\nher!",
        "There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one.",
        "Come!\u201d\n\nWe all went up to Lucy\u2019s room.",
        "Arthur by direction remained outside.",
        "Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing.",
        "She was not\nasleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort.",
        "Her eyes spoke\nto us; that was all.",
        "Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid\nthem on a little table out of sight.",
        "Then he mixed a narcotic, and\ncoming over to the bed, said cheerily:--\n\n\u201cNow, little miss, here is your medicine.",
        "Drink it off, like a good\nchild.",
        "See, I lift you so that to swallow is easy.",
        "Yes.\u201d She had made\nthe effort with success.",
        "It astonished me how long the drug took to act.",
        "This, in fact, marked\nthe extent of her weakness.",
        "The time seemed endless until sleep began to\nflicker in her eyelids.",
        "At last, however, the narcotic began to manifest\nits potency; and she fell into a deep sleep.",
        "When the Professor was\nsatisfied he called Arthur into the room, and bade him strip off his\ncoat.",
        "Then he added: \u201cYou may take that one little kiss whiles I bring\nover the table.",
        "Friend John, help to me!\u201d So neither of us looked whilst\nhe bent over her.",
        "Van Helsing, turning to me, said:--\n\n\u201cHe is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not\ndefibrinate it.\u201d\n\nThen with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed\nthe operation.",
        "As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to\ncome back to poor Lucy\u2019s cheeks, and through Arthur\u2019s growing pallor the\njoy of his face seemed absolutely to shine.",
        "After a bit I began to grow\nanxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he\nwas.",
        "It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy\u2019s system must\nhave undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.",
        "But the Professor\u2019s face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with\nhis eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur.",
        "I could hear my own\nheart beat.",
        "Presently he said in a soft voice: \u201cDo not stir an instant.",
        "It is enough.",
        "You attend him; I will look to her.\u201d When all was over I\ncould see how much Arthur was weakened.",
        "I dressed the wound and took his\narm to bring him away, when Van Helsing spoke without turning round--the\nman seems to have eyes in the back of his head:--\n\n\u201cThe brave lover I think deserve another kiss, which he shall have\npresently.\u201d And as he had now finished his operation, he adjusted the\npillow to the patient\u2019s head.",
        "As he did so the narrow black velvet band\nwhich she seemed always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old\ndiamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up,\nand showed a red mark on her throat.",
        "Arthur did not notice it, but I\ncould hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of Van Helsing\u2019s\nways of betraying emotion.",
        "He said nothing at the moment, but turned to\nme, saying: \u201cNow take down our brave young lover, give him of the port\nwine, and let him lie down a while.",
        "He must then go home and rest, sleep\nmuch and eat much, that he may be recruited of what he has so given to\nhis love.",
        "He must not stay here.",
        "Hold!",
        "a moment.",
        "I may take it, sir,\nthat you are anxious of result.",
        "Then bring it with you that in all ways\nthe operation is successful.",
        "You have saved her life this time, and you\ncan go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is.",
        "I shall tell\nher all when she is well; she shall love you none the less for what you\nhave done.",
        "Good-bye.\u201d\n\nWhen Arthur had gone I went back to the room.",
        "Lucy was sleeping gently,\nbut her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her\nbreast heaved.",
        "By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.",
        "The velvet band again covered the red mark.",
        "I asked the Professor in a\nwhisper:--\n\n\u201cWhat do you make of that mark on her throat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you make of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not seen it yet,\u201d I answered, and then and there proceeded to\nloose the band.",
        "Just over the external jugular vein there were two\npunctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking.",
        "There was no sign\nof disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some\ntrituration.",
        "It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it\nwas, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned\nthe idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be.",
        "The whole bed\nwould have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must\nhave lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.",
        "\u201cWell?\u201d said Van Helsing.",
        "\u201cWell?\u201d said I, \u201cI can make nothing of it.\u201d The Professor stood up.",
        "\u201cI must go back to Amsterdam to-night,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cThere are books and\nthings there which I want.",
        "You must remain here all the night, and you\nmust not let your sight pass from her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShall I have a nurse?\u201d I asked.",
        "\u201cWe are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that\nshe is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her.",
        "You must not sleep all\nthe night.",
        "Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as\npossible.",
        "And then we may begin.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay begin?\u201d I said.",
        "\u201cWhat on earth do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall see!\u201d he answered as he hurried out.",
        "He came back a moment\nlater and put his head inside the door, and said, with warning finger\nheld up:--\n\n\u201cRemember, she is your charge.",
        "If you leave her, and harm befall, you\nshall not sleep easy hereafter!\u201d\n\n\n_Dr.",

        "Her spirits even were\ngood, and she was full of a happy vivacity, but I could see evidences\nof the absolute prostration which she had undergone.",
        "When I told Mrs.",
        "Westenra that Dr.",
        "Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with\nher she almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter\u2019s\nrenewed strength and excellent spirits.",
        "I was firm, however, and made\npreparations for my long vigil.",
        "When her maid had prepared her for the\nnight I came in, having in the meantime had supper, and took a seat by\nthe bedside.",
        "She did not in any way make objection, but looked at me\ngratefully whenever I caught her eye.",
        "After a long spell she seemed\nsinking off to sleep, but with an effort seemed to pull herself together\nand shook it off.",
        "This was repeated several times, with greater effort\nand with shorter pauses as the time moved on.",
        "It was apparent that she\ndid not want to sleep, so I tackled the subject at once:--\n\n\u201cYou do not want to go to sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo; I am afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfraid to go to sleep!",
        "Why so?",
        "It is the boon we all crave for.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, not if you were like me--if sleep was to you a presage of horror!\u201d\n\n\u201cA presage of horror!",

        "There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad\ndreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.",
        "In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took\nmyself back home, for I was anxious about many things.",
        "I sent a short\nwire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result\nof the operation.",

        "I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams,\nfor sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little\npunctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their\nedges--tiny though they were.",

        "I smiled and nodded, and laid my finger on my\nlips; with a sigh, she sank back amid her pillows.",

        "These are medicines.\u201d Here\nLucy made a wry face.",
        "\u201cNay, but they are not to take in a decoction or\nin nauseous form, so you need not snub that so charming nose, or I shall\npoint out to my friend Arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing\nso much beauty that he so loves so much distort.",

        "Now she threw them down, saying, with half-laughter and\nhalf-disgust:--\n\n\u201cOh, Professor, I believe you are only putting up a joke on me.",
        "Why,\nthese flowers are only common garlic.\u201d\n\nTo my surprise, Van Helsing rose up and said with all his sternness, his\niron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting:--\n\n\u201cNo trifling with me!",

        "There is grim purpose in all I do;\nand I warn you that you do not thwart me.",
        "Take care, for the sake of\nothers if not for your own.\u201d Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might\nwell be, he went on more gently: \u201cOh, little miss, my dear, do not fear\nme.",
        "I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so\ncommon flower.",

        "The Professor\u2019s\nactions were certainly odd, and not to be found in any pharmacop\u0153ia\nthat I ever heard of.",
        "First, he fastened up the windows and latched them\nsecurely; next, taking a handful of the flowers, he rubbed them all over\nthe sashes, as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get\nin would be laden with the garlic smell.",
        "Then with the wisp he rubbed\nall over the jamb of the door, above, below, and at each side, and\nround the fireplace in the same way.",

        "It is well we have no sceptic here, or he\nwould say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps I am!\u201d he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which\nLucy was to wear round her neck.",
        "We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she\nwas in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her\nneck.",
        "The last words he said to her were:--\n\n\u201cTake care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do\nnot to-night open the window or the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise,\u201d said Lucy, \u201cand thank you both a thousand times for all\nyour kindness to me!",

        "To-morrow in the morning early\nyou call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much\nmore strong for my \u2018spell\u2019 which I have work.",

        "Presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning\nto be of some effect.",
        "Lucy\u2019s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the\nstethoscope, and her lungs had a perceptible movement.",
        "Van Helsing\u2019s\nface almost beamed, and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in\na hot sheet to dry her he said to me:--\n\n\u201cThe first gain is ours!",
        "Check to the King!\u201d\n\nWe took Lucy into another room, which had by now been prepared, and laid\nher in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat.",
        "I noticed\nthat Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat.",
        "She was\nstill unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had\never seen her.",
        "Van Helsing called in one of the women, and told her to stay with her\nand not to take her eyes off her till we returned, and then beckoned me\nout of the room.",
        "\u201cWe must consult as to what is to be done,\u201d he said as we descended the\nstairs.",
        "In the hall he opened the dining-room door, and we passed in,\nhe closing the door carefully behind him.",
        "The shutters had been opened,\nbut the blinds were already down, with that obedience to the etiquette\nof death which the British woman of the lower classes always rigidly\nobserves.",
        "The room was, therefore, dimly dark.",
        "It was, however, light\nenough for our purposes.",
        "Van Helsing\u2019s sternness was somewhat relieved\nby a look of perplexity.",
        "He was evidently torturing his mind about\nsomething, so I waited for an instant, and he spoke:--\n\n\u201cWhat are we to do now?",
        "Where are we to turn for help?",
        "We must have\nanother transfusion of blood, and that soon, or that poor girl\u2019s life\nwon\u2019t be worth an hour\u2019s purchase.",
        "You are exhausted already; I am\nexhausted too.",
        "I fear to trust those women, even if they would have\ncourage to submit.",
        "What are we to do for some one who will open his\nveins for her?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with me, anyhow?\u201d\n\nThe voice came from the sofa across the room, and its tones brought\nrelief and joy to my heart, for they were those of Quincey Morris.",
        "Van\nHelsing started angrily at the first sound, but his face softened and\na glad look came into his eyes as I cried out: \u201cQuincey Morris!\u201d and\nrushed towards him with outstretched hands.",
        "\u201cWhat brought you here?\u201d I cried as our hands met.",
        "\u201cI guess Art is the cause.\u201d\n\nHe handed me a telegram:--\n\n\u201cHave not heard from Seward for three days, and am terribly anxious.",
        "Cannot leave.",
        "Father still in same condition.",
        "Send me word how Lucy is.",
        "Do not delay.--/Holmwood./\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I came just in the nick of time.",
        "You know you have only to tell\nme what to do.\u201d\n\nVan Helsing strode forward and took his hand, looking him straight in\nthe eyes as he said:--\n\n\u201cA brave man\u2019s blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in\ntrouble.",
        "You\u2019re a man, and no mistake.",
        "Well, the devil may work against\nus for all he\u2019s worth, but God sends us men when we want them.\u201d\n\nOnce again we went through that ghastly operation.",
        "I have not the heart\nto go through with the details.",
        "Lucy had got a terrible shock, and it\ntold on her more than before, for though plenty of blood went into her\nveins, her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other\noccasions.",
        "Her struggle back into life was something frightful to see\nand hear.",
        "However, the action of both heart and lungs improved, and Van\nHelsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia, as before, and with\ngood effect.",
        "Her faint became a profound slumber.",
        "The Professor watched\nwhilst I went downstairs with Quincey Morris, and sent one of the maids\nto pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting.",
        "I left Quincey lying down\nafter having a glass of wine, and told the cook to get ready a good\nbreakfast.",
        "Then a thought struck me, and I went back to the room where\nLucy now was.",
        "When I came softly in, I found Van Helsing with a sheet\nor two of note-paper in his hand.",
        "He had evidently read it, and was\nthinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow.",
        "There was a look\nof grim satisfaction in his face, as of one who has had a doubt solved.",
        "He handed me the paper, saying only: \u201cIt dropped from Lucy\u2019s breast when\nwe carried her to the bath.\u201d\n\nWhen I had read it, I stood looking at the Professor, and after a pause\nasked him: \u201cIn God\u2019s name, what does it all mean?",
        "Was she, or is she,\nmad; or what sort of horrible danger is it?\u201d I was so bewildered that I\ndid not know what to say more.",
        "Van Helsing put out his hand and took the\npaper, saying:--\n\n\u201cDo not trouble about it now.",
        "Forget it for the present.",
        "You shall know\nand understand it all in good time; but it will be later.",
        "And now what\nis that you came to me to say?\u201d This brought me back to fact, and I was\nall myself again.",
        "\u201cI came to speak about the certificate of death.",
        "If we do not act\nproperly and wisely, there may be an inquest, and that paper would have\nto be produced.",
        "I am in hopes that we need have no inquest, for if we\nhad it would surely kill poor Lucy, if nothing else did.",
        "I know, and you\nknow, and the other doctor who attended her knows, that Mrs.",
        "Westenra\nhad disease of the heart, and we can certify that she died of it.",
        "Let\nus fill up the certificate at once, and I shall take it myself to the\nregistrar and go on to the undertaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, oh my friend John!",
        "Well thought of!",
        "Truly Miss Lucy, if she be\nsad in the foes that beset her, is at least happy in the friends that\nlove her.",
        "One, two, three, all open their veins for her, besides one old\nman.",
        "Ah yes, I know, friend John; I am not blind!",
        "I love you all the\nmore for it!",
        "Now go.\u201d\n\nIn the hall I met Quincey Morris, with a telegram for Arthur telling him\nthat Mrs.",
        "Westenra was dead; that Lucy also had been ill, but was now\ngoing on better; and that Van Helsing and I were with her.",
        "I told him\nwhere I was going, and he hurried me out, but as I was going said:--\n\n\u201cWhen you come back, Jack, may I have two words with you all to\nourselves?\u201d I nodded in reply and went out.",
        "I found no difficulty about\nthe registration, and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in\nthe evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements.",
        "When I got back Quincey was waiting for me.",
        "I told him I would see him\nas soon as I knew about Lucy, and went up to her room.",
        "She was still\nsleeping, and the Professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at\nher side.",
        "From his putting his finger to his lips, I gathered that he\nexpected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature.",
        "So I went down to Quincey and took him into the breakfast-room, where\nthe blinds were not drawn down, and which was a little more cheerful,\nor rather less cheerless, than the other rooms.",
        "When we were alone, he\nsaid to me:--\n\n\u201cJack Seward, I don\u2019t want to shove myself in anywhere where I\u2019ve no\nright to be; but this is no ordinary case.",
        "You know I loved that girl\nand wanted to marry her; but, although that\u2019s all past and gone, I\ncan\u2019t help feeling anxious about her all the same.",
        "What is it that\u2019s\nwrong with her?",
        "The Dutchman--and a fine old fellow he is; I can see\nthat--said, that time you two came into the room, that you must have\n_another_ transfusion of blood, and that both you and he were exhausted.",
        "Now I know well that you medical men speak _in camera_, and that a man\nmust not expect to know what they consult about in private.",
        "But this is\nno common matter, and, whatever it is, I have done my part.",
        "Is not that\nso?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d I said, and he went on:--\n\n\u201cI take it that both you and Van Helsing had done already what I did\nto-day.",
        "Is not that so?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I guess Art was in it too.",
        "When I saw him four days ago down at\nhis own place he looked queer.",
        "I have not seen anything pulled down so\nquick since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go\nto grass all in a night.",
        "One of those big bats that they call vampires\nhad got at her in the night, and, what with his gorge and the vein left\nopen, there wasn\u2019t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to\nput a bullet through her as she lay.",
        "Jack, if you may tell me without\nbetraying confidence, Arthur was the first; is not that so?\u201d As he\nspoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious.",
        "He was in a torture of\nsuspense regarding the woman he loved, and his utter ignorance of the\nterrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain.",
        "His\nvery heart was bleeding, and it took all the manhood of him--and there\nwas a royal lot of it, too--to keep him from breaking down.",
        "I paused\nbefore answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the\nProfessor wished kept secret, but already he knew so much, and guessed\nso much, that there could be no reason for not answering, so I answered\nin the same phrase: \u201cThat\u2019s so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how long has this been going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout ten days.\u201d\n\n\u201cTen days!",
        "Then I guess, Jack Seward, that that poor pretty creature\nthat we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood\nof four strong men.",
        "Man alive, her whole body wouldn\u2019t hold it.\u201d Then,\ncoming close to me, he spoke in a fierce half-whisper: \u201cWhat took it\nout?\u201d\n\nI shook my head.",
        "\u201cThat,\u201d I said, \u201cis the crux.",
        "Van Helsing is simply\nfrantic about it, and I am at my wits\u2019 end.",
        "I can\u2019t even hazard a guess.",
        "There has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out\nall our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched.",
        "But these shall\nnot occur again.",
        "Here we stay until all be well--or ill.\u201d Quincey held\nout his hand.",
        "\u201cCount me in,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cYou and the Dutchman will tell me\nwhat to do, and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nWhen she woke late in the afternoon, Lucy\u2019s first movement was to feel\nin her breast, and, to my surprise, produced the paper which Van Helsing\nhad given me to read.",
        "The careful Professor had replaced it where it\nhad come from, lest on waking she should be alarmed.",
        "Her eye then lit\non Van Helsing and on me too, and gladdened.",
        "Then she looked round the\nroom, and seeing where she was, shuddered; she gave a loud cry, and put\nher poor thin hands before her pale face.",
        "We both understood what that\nmeant--that she had realised to the full her mother\u2019s death; so we tried\nwhat we could to comfort her.",
        "Doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat, but\nshe was very low in thought and spirit, and wept silently and weakly for\na long time.",
        "We told her that either or both of us would now remain with\nher all the time, and that seemed to comfort her.",
        "Towards dusk she fell\ninto a doze.",
        "Here a very odd thing occurred.",
        "Whilst still asleep she\ntook the paper from her breast and tore it in two.",
        "Van Helsing stepped\nover and took the pieces from her.",
        "All the same, however, she went on\nwith the action of tearing, as though the material were still in her\nhands; finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering\nthe fragments.",
        "Van Helsing seemed surprised, and his brows gathered as\nif in thought, but he said nothing.",
        "_19 September._--All last night she slept fitfully, being always afraid\nto sleep, and something weaker when she woke from it.",
        "The Professor\nand I took it in turns to watch, and we never left her for a moment\nunattended.",
        "Quincey Morris said nothing about his intention, but I knew\nthat all night long he patrolled round and round the house.",
        "When the day came, its searching light showed the ravages in poor\nLucy\u2019s strength.",
        "She was hardly able to turn her head, and the little\nnourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good.",
        "At times she\nslept, and both Van Helsing and I noticed the difference in her, between\nsleeping and waking.",
        "Whilst asleep she looked stronger, although more\nhaggard, and her breathing was softer; her open mouth showed the pale\ngums drawn back from the teeth, which thus looked positively longer and\nsharper than usual; when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently\nchanged the expression, for she looked her own self, although a dying\none.",
        "In the afternoon she asked for Arthur, and we telegraphed for him.",
        "Quincey went off to meet him at the station.",
        "When he arrived it was nearly six o\u2019clock, and the sun was setting full\nand warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave\nmore colour to the pale cheeks.",
        "When he saw her, Arthur was simply\nchoked with emotion, and none of us could speak.",
        "In the hours that had\npassed, the fits of sleep, or the comatose condition that passed for\nit, had grown more frequent, so that the pauses when conversation was\npossible were shortened.",
        "Arthur\u2019s presence, however, seemed to act as a\nstimulant; she rallied a little, and spoke to him more brightly than she\nhad done since we arrived.",
        "He too pulled himself together, and spoke as\ncheerily as he could, so that the best was made of everything.",
        "It is now nearly one o\u2019clock, and he and Van Helsing are sitting with\nher.",
        "I am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour, and I am entering\nthis on Lucy\u2019s phonograph.",
        "Until six o\u2019clock they are to try to rest.",
        "I\nfear that to-morrow will end our watching, for the shock has been too\ngreat; the poor child cannot rally.",

        "He took us to his own house, where there\nwere rooms for us all nice and comfortable, and we dined together.",

        "He is beginning\nto put some flesh on his bones again, but he was terribly weakened by\nthe long illness; even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a\nsudden way and awakes all trembling until I can coax him back to his\nusual placidity.",
        "However, thank God, these occasions grow less frequent\nas the days go on, and they will in time pass away altogether, I trust.",
        "And now I have told you my news, let me ask yours.",
        "When are you to be\nmarried, and where, and who is to perform the ceremony, and what are\nyou to wear, and is it to be a public or a private wedding?",

        "The man, who seemed a\ndecent fellow enough, contented himself by telling him to \u2018shut up for\na foul-mouthed beggar,\u2019 whereon our man accused him of robbing him and\nwanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to\nswing for it.",
        "I opened the window and signed to the man not to notice,\nso he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his\nmind as to what kind of place he had got to by saying: \u2018Lor\u2019 bless yer,\nsir, I wouldn\u2019t mind what was said to me in a bloomin\u2019 madhouse.",
        "I pity\nye and the guv\u2019nor for havin\u2019 to live in the house with a wild beast\nlike that.\u2019 Then he asked the way civilly enough, and I told him where\nthe gate of the empty house was; he went away, followed by threats and\ncurses and revilings from our man.",
        "I went down to see if I could make\nout any cause for his anger, since he is usually such a well-behaved\nman, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred.",
        "I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most genial in his\nmanner.",
        "I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he blandly asked\nme questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe that he was\ncompletely oblivious of the affair.",
        "It was, I am sorry to say, however,\nonly another instance of his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of\nhim again.",
        "This time he had broken out through the window of his room,\nand was running down the avenue.",
        "I called to the attendants to follow\nme, and ran after him, for I feared he was intent on some mischief.",
        "My\nfear was justified when I saw the same cart which had passed before\ncoming down the road, having on it some great wooden boxes.",
        "The men were\nwiping their foreheads, and were flushed in the face, as if with violent\nexercise.",
        "Before I could get up to him the patient rushed at them, and\npulling one of them off the cart, began to knock his head against the\nground.",
        "If I had not seized him just at the moment I believe he would\nhave killed the man there and then.",
        "The other fellow jumped down and\nstruck him over the head with the butt-end of his heavy whip.",
        "It was\na terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but seized him also,\nand struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were\nkittens.",
        "You know I am no light weight, and the others were both burly\nmen.",
        "At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we began to master\nhim, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat on him, he\nbegan to shout: \u2018I\u2019ll frustrate them!",

        "I never knew\neither father or mother, so that the dear old man\u2019s death is a real blow\nto me.",
        "Jonathan is greatly distressed.",
        "It is not only that he feels\nsorrow, deep sorrow, for the dear, good man who has befriended him all\nhis life, and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left\nhim a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond\nthe dream of avarice, but Jonathan feels it on another account.",
        "He says\nthe amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous.",
        "He begins to doubt himself.",
        "I try to cheer him up, and _my_ belief in\n_him_ helps him to have a belief in himself.",
        "But it is here that the\ngrave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most.",
        "Oh, it is too\nhard that a sweet, simple, noble, strong nature such as his--a nature\nwhich enabled him by our dear, good friend\u2019s aid, to rise from clerk to\nmaster in a few years--should be so injured that the very essence of\nits strength is gone.",
        "Forgive me, dear, if I worry you with my troubles\nin the midst of your own happiness; but, Lucy dear, I must tell some\none, for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to\nJonathan tries me, and I have no one here that I can confide in.",
        "I dread\ncoming up to London, as we must do the day after to-morrow; for poor Mr.",
        "Hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his\nfather.",
        "As there are no relations at all, Jonathan will have to be chief\nmourner.",
        "I shall try to run over to see you, dearest, if only for a few\nminutes.",

        "Seward\u2019s Diary._\n\n_20 September._--Only resolution and habit can let me make an entry\nto-night.",
        "I am too miserable, too low-spirited, too sick of the world\nand all in it, including life itself, and I would not care if I heard\nthis moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death.",
        "And he has\nbeen flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late--Lucy\u2019s mother\nand Arthur\u2019s father, and now.... Let me get on with my work.",
        "I duly relieved Van Helsing in his watch over Lucy.",
        "We wanted Arthur to\ngo to rest also, but he refused at first.",
        "It was only when I told him\nthat we should want him to help us during the day, and that we must not\nall break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed\nto go.",
        "Van Helsing was very kind to him.",
        "\u201cCome, my child,\u201d he said;\n\u201ccome with me.",
        "You are sick and weak, and have had much sorrow and much\nmental pain, as well as that tax on your strength that we know of.",
        "You\nmust not be alone; for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms.",
        "Come to the drawing-room, where there is a big fire, and there are two\nsofas.",
        "You shall lie on one, and I on the other, and our sympathy will\nbe comfort for each other, even though we do not speak, and even if\nwe sleep.\u201d Arthur went off with him, casting back a longing look on\nLucy\u2019s face, which lay on her pillow, almost whiter than the lawn.",
        "She\nlay quite still, and I looked round the room to see that all was as\nit should be.",
        "I could see that the Professor had carried out in this\nroom, as in the other, his purpose of using the garlic; the whole of\nthe window-sashes reeked with it, and round Lucy\u2019s neck, over the silk\nhandkerchief which Van Helsing made her keep on, was a rough chaplet of\nthe same odorous flowers.",
        "Lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously, and\nher face was at its worst, for the open mouth showed the pale gums.",
        "Her\nteeth, in the dim, uncertain light, seemed longer and sharper than they\nhad been in the morning.",
        "In particular, by some trick of the light, the\ncanine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest.",
        "I sat down by her,\nand presently she moved uneasily.",
        "At the same moment there came a sort\nof dull flapping or buffeting at the window.",
        "I went over to it softly,\nand peeped out by the corner of the blind.",
        "There was a full moonlight,\nand I could see that the noise was made by a great bat, which wheeled\nround--doubtless attracted by the light, although so dim--and every\nnow and again struck the window with its wings.",
        "When I came back to my\nseat I found that Lucy had moved slightly, and had torn away the garlic\nflowers from her throat.",
        "I replaced them as well as I could, and sat\nwatching her.",
        "Presently she woke, and I gave her food, as Van Helsing had prescribed.",
        "She took but a little, and that languidly.",
        "There did not seem to be\nwith her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had\nhitherto so marked her illness.",
        "It struck me as curious that the moment\nshe became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her.",
        "It was\ncertainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state, with the\nstertorous breathing, she put the flowers from her; but that when she\nwaked she clutched them close.",
        "There was no possibility of making any\nmistake about this, for in the long hours that followed, she had many\nspells of sleeping and waking, and repeated both actions many times.",
        "At six o\u2019clock Van Helsing came to relieve me.",
        "Arthur had then fallen\ninto a doze, and he mercifully let him sleep on.",
        "When he saw Lucy\u2019s face\nI could hear the hissing indraw of his breath, and he said to me in a\nsharp whisper: \u201cDraw up the blind; I want light!\u201d Then he bent down,\nand, with his face almost touching Lucy\u2019s, examined her carefully.",
        "He\nremoved the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat.",
        "As he did so he started back, and I could hear his ejaculation, \u201cMein\nGott!\u201d as it was smothered in his throat.",
        "I bent over and looked too,\nand as I noticed some queer chill came over me.",
        "The wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared.",
        "For fully five minutes Van Helsing stood looking at her, with his face\nat its sternest.",
        "Then he turned to me and said calmly:--\n\n\u201cShe is dying.",
        "It will not be long now.",
        "It will be much difference, mark\nme, whether she dies conscious or in her sleep.",
        "Wake that poor boy, and\nlet him come and see the last; he trusts us, and we have promised him.\u201d\n\nI went to the dining-room and waked him.",
        "He was dazed for a moment, but\nwhen he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters\nhe thought he was late, and expressed his fear.",
        "I assured him that\nLucy was still asleep, but told him as gently as I could that both Van\nHelsing and I feared that the end was near.",
        "He covered his face with\nhis hands, and slid down on his knees by the sofa, where he remained,\nperhaps a minute, with his hands buried, praying, whilst his shoulders\nshook with grief.",
        "I took him by the hand and raised him up.",
        "\u201cCome,\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cmy dear old fellow, summon all your fortitude; it will be best\nand easiest for _her_.\u201d\n\nWhen we came into Lucy\u2019s room I could see that Van Helsing had, with his\nusual forethought, been putting matters straight and making everything\nlook as pleasing as possible.",
        "He had even brushed Lucy\u2019s hair, so that\nit lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples.",
        "When we came into the\nroom she opened her eyes, and seeing him, whispered softly:--\n\n\u201cArthur!",
        "Oh, my love, I am glad you have come!\u201d He was stooping to kiss\nher, when Van Helsing motioned him back.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered, \u201cnot yet!",
        "Hold her hand; it will comfort her more.\u201d\n\nSo Arthur took her hand and knelt beside her, and she looked her best,\nwith all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes.",
        "Then\ngradually her eyes closed, and she sank to sleep.",
        "For a little bit her\nbreast heaved softly, and her breath came and went like a tired child\u2019s.",
        "And then insensibly there came the strange change which I had noticed in\nthe night.",
        "Her breathing grew stertorous, the mouth opened, and the pale\ngums, drawn back, made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever.",
        "In a\nsort of sleep-waking, vague, unconscious way she opened her eyes, which\nwere now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft voluptuous voice,\nsuch as I had never heard from her lips:--\n\n\u201cArthur!",
        "Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come!",
        "Kiss me!\u201d Arthur bent\neagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me,\nhad been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by\nthe neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which\nI never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost\nacross the room.",
        "\u201cNot for your life!\u201d he said; \u201cnot for your living soul and hers!\u201d And\nhe stood between them like a lion at bay.",
        "Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do\nor say; and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised\nthe place and the occasion, and he stood silent, waiting.",
        "I kept my eyes fixed on Lucy, as did Van Helsing, and we saw a spasm\nas of rage flit like a shadow over her face; the sharp teeth champed\ntogether.",
        "Then her eyes closed, and she breathed heavily.",
        "Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and\nputting out her poor pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing\u2019s great brown\none; drawing it to her, she kissed it.",
        "\u201cMy true friend,\u201d she said, in a\nfaint voice, but with untellable pathos, \u201cMy true friend, and his!",
        "Oh,\nguard him, and give me peace!\u201d\n\n\u201cI swear it!\u201d said he solemnly, kneeling beside her and holding up his\nhand, as one who registers an oath.",
        "Then he turned to Arthur, and said\nto him: \u201cCome, my child, take her hand in yours, and kiss her on the\nforehead, and only once.\u201d\n\nTheir eyes met instead of their lips; and so they parted.",
        "Lucy\u2019s eyes closed; and Van Helsing, who had been watching closely, took\nArthur\u2019s arm, and drew him away.",
        "And then Lucy\u2019s breathing became stertorous again, and all at once it\nceased.",
        "\u201cIt is all over,\u201d said Van Helsing.",
        "\u201cShe is dead!\u201d\n\nI took Arthur by the arm, and led him away to the drawing-room, where\nhe sat down, and covered his face with his hands, sobbing in a way that\nnearly broke me down to see.",
        "I went back to the room, and found Van Helsing looking at poor Lucy,\nand his face was sterner than ever.",
        "Some change had come over her body.",
        "Death had given back part of her beauty, for her brow and cheeks had\nrecovered some of their flowing lines; even the lips had lost their\ndeadly pallor.",
        "It was as if the blood, no longer needed for the working\nof the heart, had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as\nmight be.",
        "\u201cWe thought her dying whilst she slept,\n        And sleeping when she died.\u201d\n\nI stood beside Van Helsing, and said:--\n\n\u201cAh, well, poor girl, there is peace for her at last.",
        "It is the end!\u201d\n\nHe turned to me, and said with grave solemnity:--\n\n\u201cNot so!",
        "alas!",
        "not so.",
        "It is only the beginning!\u201d\n\nWhen I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered:--\n\n\u201cWe can do nothing as yet.",
        "Wait and see.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.",

        "Seward\u2019s Diary/--_continued._\n\n\nThe funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day, so that Lucy and\nher mother might be buried together.",
        "I attended to all the ghastly\nformalities, and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were\nafflicted--or blessed--with something of his own obsequious suavity.",
        "Even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to\nme, in a confidential, brother-professional way, when she had come out\nfrom the death-chamber:--\n\n\u201cShe makes a very beautiful corpse, sir.",
        "It\u2019s quite a privilege to\nattend on her.",
        "It\u2019s not too much to say that she will do credit to our\nestablishment!\u201d\n\nI noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away.",
        "This was possible\nfrom the disordered state of things in the household.",
        "There were no\nrelatives at hand; and as Arthur had to be back the next day to attend\nat his father\u2019s funeral, we were unable to notify any one who should\nhave been bidden.",
        "Under the circumstances, Van Helsing and I took it\nupon ourselves to examine papers, etc.",
        "He insisted upon looking over\nLucy\u2019s papers himself.",
        "I asked him why, for I feared that he, being a\nforeigner, might not be quite aware of English legal requirements, and\nso might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble.",
        "He answered me:--\n\n\u201cI know; I know.",
        "You forget that I am a lawyer as well as a doctor.",
        "But\nthis is not altogether for the law.",
        "You knew that, when you avoided the\ncoroner.",
        "I have more than him to avoid.",
        "There may be papers more--such\nas this.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke he took from his pocket-book the memorandum which had been\nin Lucy\u2019s breast, and which she had torn in her sleep.",
        "\u201cWhen you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late Mrs.",
        "Westenra, seal all her papers, and write him to-night.",

        "It is not well that her very thoughts go into\nthe hands of strangers.\u201d\n\nI went on with my part of the work, and in another half-hour had found\nthe name and address of Mrs.",
        "Westenra\u2019s solicitor and had written to\nhim.",
        "All the poor lady\u2019s papers were in order; explicit directions\nregarding the place of burial were given.",
        "I had hardly sealed the\nletter, when, to my surprise, Van Helsing walked into the room,\nsaying:--\n\n\u201cCan I help you, friend John?",
        "I am free, and if I may, my service is to\nyou.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you got what you looked for?\u201d I asked, to which he replied:--\n\n\u201cI did not look for any specific thing.",
        "I only hoped to find, and find I\nhave, all that there was--only some letters and a few memoranda, and a\ndiary new begun.",
        "But I have them here, and we shall for the present say\nnothing of them.",
        "I shall see that poor lad to-morrow evening, and, with\nhis sanction, I shall use some.\u201d\n\nWhen we had finished the work in hand, he said to me:--\n\n\u201cAnd now, friend John, I think we may to bed.",
        "We want sleep, both you\nand I, and rest to recuperate.",
        "To-morrow we shall have much to do, but\nfor the to-night there is no need of us.",
        "Alas!\u201d\n\nBefore turning in we went to look at poor Lucy.",
        "The undertaker had\ncertainly done his work well, for the room was turned into a small\n_chapelle ardente_.",
        "There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers,\nand death was made as little repulsive as might be.",
        "The end of the\nwinding-sheet was laid over the face; when the Professor bent over\nand turned it gently back, we both started at the beauty before us,\nthe tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well.",
        "All\nLucy\u2019s loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had\npassed, instead of leaving traces of \u201cdecay\u2019s effacing fingers,\u201d had but\nrestored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes\nthat I was looking at a corpse.",
        "The Professor looked sternly grave.",
        "He had not loved her as I had, and\nthere was no need for tears in his eyes.",
        "He said to me: \u201cRemain till I\nreturn,\u201d and left the room.",
        "He came back with a handful of wild garlic\nfrom the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and\nplaced the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed.",
        "Then he\ntook from his neck, inside his collar, a little golden crucifix, and\nplaced it over the mouth.",
        "He restored the sheet to its place, and we\ncame away.",
        "I was undressing in my own room, when, with a premonitory tap at the\ndoor, he entered, and at once began to speak:--\n\n\u201cTo-morrow I want you to bring me, before night, a set of post-mortem\nknives.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust we make an autopsy?\u201d I asked.",
        "\u201cYes, and no.",
        "I want to operate, but not as you think.",
        "Let me tell you\nnow, but not a word to another.",
        "I want to cut off her head and take out\nher heart.",
        "Ah!",
        "you a surgeon, and so shocked!",
        "You, whom I have seen\nwith no tremble of hand or heart, do operations of life and death that\nmake the rest shudder.",
        "Oh, but I must not forget, my dear friend John,\nthat you loved her; and I have not forgotten it, for it is I that shall\noperate, and you must only help.",
        "I would like to do it to-night, but for\nArthur I must not; he will be free after his father\u2019s funeral to-morrow,\nand he will want to see her--to see _it_.",
        "Then, when she is coffined\nready for the next day, you and I shall come when all sleep.",
        "We shall\nunscrew the coffin-lid, and shall do our operation; and then replace\nall, so that none know, save we alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why do it at all?",
        "The girl is dead.",
        "Why mutilate her poor body\nwithout need?",
        "And if there is no necessity for a post-mortem and\nnothing to gain by it--no good to her, to us, to science, to human\nknowledge--why do it?",
        "Without such it is monstrous.\u201d\n\nFor answer he put his hand on my shoulder, and said, with infinite\ntenderness:--\n\n\u201cFriend John, I pity your poor bleeding heart; and I love you the more\nbecause it does so bleed.",
        "If I could, I would take on myself the burden\nthat you do bear.",
        "But there are things that you know not, but that you\nshall know, and bless me for knowing, though they are not pleasant\nthings.",
        "John, my child, you have been my friend now many years, and yet\ndid you ever know me to do any without good cause?",
        "I may err--I am but\nman; but I believe in all I do.",
        "Was it not for these causes that you\nsend for me when the great trouble came?",
        "Yes!",
        "Were you not amazed, nay\nhorrified, when I would not let Arthur kiss his love--though she was\ndying--and snatched him away by all my strength?",
        "Yes!",
        "And yet you saw\nhow she thanked me, with her so beautiful dying eyes, her voice, too, so\nweak, and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me?",
        "Yes!",
        "And did you not\nhear me swear promise to her, that so she closed her eyes grateful?",
        "Yes!",
        "\u201cWell, I have good reason now for all I want to do.",
        "You have for many\nyears trust me; you have believe me weeks past, when there be things so\nstrange that you might have well doubt.",
        "Believe me yet a little, friend\nJohn.",
        "If you trust me not, then I must tell what I think; and that is\nnot perhaps well.",
        "And if I work--as work I shall, no matter trust or no\ntrust--without my friend trust in me, I work with heavy heart, and feel,\noh!",
        "so lonely when I want all help and courage that may be!\u201d He paused\na moment, and went on solemnly: \u201cFriend John, there are strange and\nterrible days before us.",
        "Let us not be two, but one, that so we work to\na good end.",
        "Will you not have faith in me?\u201d\n\nI took his hand, and promised him.",
        "I held my door open as he went away,\nand watched him go into his room and close the door.",
        "As I stood without\nmoving, I saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage--she had\nher back towards me, so did not see me--and go into the room where Lucy\nlay.",
        "The sight touched me.",
        "Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful\nto those who show it unasked to those we love.",
        "Here was a poor girl\nputting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch\nalone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay\nmight not be lonely till laid to eternal rest....\n\nI must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van\nHelsing waked me by coming into my room.",
        "He came over to my bedside and\nsaid:--\n\n\u201cYou need not trouble about the knives; we shall not do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked.",
        "For his solemnity of the night before had greatly\nimpressed me.",
        "\u201cBecause,\u201d he said sternly, \u201cit is too late--or too early.",
        "See!\u201d Here he\nheld up the little golden crucifix.",
        "\u201cThis was stolen in the night.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow stolen,\u201d I asked in wonder, \u201csince you have it now?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it, from the\nwoman who robbed the dead and the living.",
        "Her punishment will surely\ncome, but not through me; she knew not altogether what she did, and thus\nunknowing, she only stole.",
        "Now we must wait.\u201d\n\nHe went away on the word, leaving me with a new mystery to think of, a\nnew puzzle to grapple with.",
        "The forenoon was a dreary time, but at noon the solicitor came: Mr.",
        "Marquand, of Wholeman, Sons, Marquand & Lidderdale.",
        "He was very genial\nand very appreciative of what we had done, and took off our hands all\ncares as to details.",
        "During lunch he told us that Mrs.",
        "Westenra had for\nsome time expected sudden death from her heart, and had put her affairs\nin absolute order; he informed us that, with the exception of a certain\nentailed property of Lucy\u2019s father which now, in default of direct\nissue, went back to a distant branch of the family, the whole estate,\nreal and personal, was left absolutely to Arthur Holmwood.",
        "When he had\ntold us so much he went on:--\n\n\u201cFrankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition, and\npointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either\npenniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial\nalliance.",
        "Indeed, we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into\ncollision, for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry\nout her wishes.",
        "Of course, we had then no alternative but to accept.",

        "Frankly, however, I must admit that in this case any other\nform of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of\nher wishes.",
        "For by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have\ncome into possession of the property, and, even had she only survived\nher mother by five minutes, her property would, in case there were no\nwill--and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case--have\nbeen treated at her decease as under intestacy.",
        "In which case, Lord\nGodalming, though so dear a friend, would have had no claim in the\nworld; and the inheritors, being remote, would not be likely to abandon\ntheir just rights for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger.",
        "I assure you, my dear sirs, I am rejoiced at the result, perfectly\nrejoiced.\u201d\n\nHe was a good fellow, but his rejoicing at the one little part--in which\nhe was officially interested--of so great a tragedy was an object-lesson\nin the limitations of sympathetic understanding.",
        "He did not remain long, but said he would look in later in the day and\nsee Lord Godalming.",
        "His coming, however, had been a certain comfort\nto us, since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile\ncriticism as to any of our acts.",
        "Arthur was expected at five o\u2019clock,\nso a little before that time we visited the death-chamber.",
        "It was so in\nvery truth, for now both mother and daughter lay in it.",
        "The undertaker,\ntrue to his craft, had made the best display he could of his goods,\nand there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits\nat once.",
        "Van Helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to,\nexplaining that, as Lord Godalming was coming very soon, it would be\nless harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his _fianc\u00e9e_\nquite alone.",
        "The undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity, and\nexerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them\nthe night before, so that when Arthur came such shocks to his feelings\nas we could avoid were saved.",
        "Poor fellow!",
        "He looked desperately sad and broken; even his stalwart\nmanhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his\nmuch-tried emotions.",
        "He had, I knew, been very genuinely and devotedly\nattached to his father; and to lose him, and at such a time, was a\nbitter blow to him.",
        "With me he was warm as ever, and to Van Helsing he\nwas sweetly courteous; but I could not help seeing that there was some\nconstraint with him.",
        "The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to\nbring him upstairs.",
        "I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as\nI felt he would like to be quite alone with her; but he took my arm and\nled me in, saying huskily:--\n\n\u201cYou loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was\nno friend had a closer place in her heart than you.",
        "I don\u2019t know how to\nthank you for all you have done for her.",
        "I can\u2019t think yet....\u201d\n\nHere he suddenly broke down, and threw his arms round my shoulders and\nlaid his head on my breast, crying:--\n\n\u201cOh, Jack!",
        "Jack!",
        "What shall I do?",
        "The whole of life seems gone from me\nall at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.\u201d\n\nI comforted him as well as I could.",
        "In such cases men do not need much\nexpression.",
        "A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the\nshoulder, a sob in unison, are expressions of sympathy dear to a man\u2019s\nheart.",
        "I stood still and silent till his sobs died away, and then I said\nsoftly to him:--\n\n\u201cCome and look at her.\u201d\n\nTogether we moved over to the bed, and I lifted the lawn from her face.",
        "God!",
        "how beautiful she was.",
        "Every hour seemed to be enhancing her\nloveliness.",
        "It frightened and amazed me somewhat; and as for Arthur, he\nfell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague.",
        "At\nlast, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:--\n\n\u201cJack, is she really dead?\u201d\n\nI assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest--for I felt\nthat such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer\nthan I could help--that it often happened that after death faces became\nsoftened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was\nespecially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged\nsuffering.",
        "It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after\nkneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and\nlong, he turned aside.",
        "I told him that that must be good-bye, as the\ncoffin had to be prepared; so he went back and took her dead hand in\nhis and kissed it, and bent over and kissed her forehead.",
        "He came away,\nfondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came.",
        "I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said\ngood-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker\u2019s\nmen to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin.",
        "When\nhe came out of the room again I told him of Arthur\u2019s question, and he\nreplied:--\n\n\u201cI am not surprised.",
        "Just now I doubted for a moment myself!\u201d\n\nWe all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make\nthe best of things.",
        "Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time, but\nwhen we had lit our cigars he said:--\n\n\u201cLord----;\u201d but Arthur interrupted him:--\n\n\u201cNo, no, not that, for God\u2019s sake!",
        "not yet at any rate.",
        "Forgive me, sir:\nI did not mean to speak offensively; it is only because my loss is so\nrecent.\u201d\n\nThe Professor answered very sweetly:--\n\n\u201cI only used that name because I was in doubt.",
        "I must not call you\n\u2018Mr.,\u2019 and I have grown to love you--yes, my dear boy, to love you--as\nArthur.\u201d\n\nArthur held out his hand, and took the old man\u2019s warmly.",
        "\u201cCall me what you will,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cI hope I may always have the title of\na friend.",
        "And let me say that I am at a loss for words to thank you for\nyour goodness to my poor dear.\u201d He paused a moment, and went on: \u201cI know\nthat she understood your goodness even better than I do; and if I was\nrude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so--you remember\u201d--the\nProfessor nodded--\u201cyou must forgive me.\u201d\n\nHe answered with a grave kindness:--\n\n\u201cI know it was hard for you to quite trust me then, for to trust such\nviolence needs to understand; and I take it that you do not--that you\ncannot--trust me now, for you do not yet understand.",
        "And there may be\nmore times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot--and may\nnot--and must not yet understand.",
        "But the time will come when your trust\nshall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as\nthough the sunlight himself shone through.",
        "Then you shall bless me from\nfirst to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others, and for her\ndear sake to whom I swore to protect.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd, indeed, indeed, sir,\u201d said Arthur warmly, \u201cI shall in all ways\ntrust you.",
        "I know and believe you have a very noble heart, and you are\nJack\u2019s friend, and you were hers.",
        "You shall do what you like.\u201d\n\nThe Professor cleared his throat a couple of times, as though about to\nspeak, and finally said:--\n\n\u201cMay I ask you something now?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know that Mrs.",
        "Westenra left you all her property?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, poor dear; I never thought of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd as it is all yours, you have a right to deal with it as you will.",
        "I want you to give me permission to read all Miss Lucy\u2019s papers and\nletters.",
        "Believe me, it is no idle curiosity.",
        "I have a motive of which,\nbe sure, she would have approved.",
        "I have them all here.",
        "I took them\nbefore we knew that all was yours, so that no strange hand might touch\nthem--no strange eye look through words into her soul.",
        "I shall keep\nthem, if I may; even you may not see them yet, but I shall keep them\nsafe.",
        "No word shall be lost; and in the good time I shall give them back\nto you.",
        "It\u2019s a hard thing I ask, but you will do it, will you not, for\nLucy\u2019s sake?\u201d\n\nArthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:--\n\n\u201cDr.",
        "Van Helsing, you may do what you will.",
        "I feel that in saying this I\nam doing what my dear one would have approved.",
        "I shall not trouble you\nwith questions till the time comes.\u201d\n\nThe old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:--\n\n\u201cAnd you are right.",
        "There will be pain for us all; but it will not be\nall pain, nor will this pain be the last.",
        "We and you too--you most of\nall, my dear boy--will have to pass through the bitter water before we\nreach the sweet.",
        "But we must be brave of heart and unselfish, and do our\nduty, and all will be well!\u201d\n\nI slept on a sofa in Arthur\u2019s room that night.",
        "Van Helsing did not go\nto bed at all.",
        "He went to and fro, as if patrolling the house, and was\nnever out of sight of the room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with\nthe wild garlic flowers, which sent, through the odour of lily and rose,\na heavy, overpowering smell into the night.",

        "He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and\nhalf in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and\nblack moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty\ngirl.",

        "If I do, or if I ever open this again, it will be to deal with\ndifferent people and different themes; for here at the end, where the\nromance of my life is told, ere I go back to take up the thread of my\nlife-work, I say sadly and without hope,\n\n\u201c/Finis./\u201d\n\n\n_The \u201cWestminster Gazette,\u201d 25 September._\n\n/A Hampstead Mystery./\n\nThe neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a\nseries of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what\nwas known to the writers of headlines as \u201cThe Kensington Horror,\u201d or\n\u201cThe Stabbing Woman,\u201d or \u201cThe Woman in Black.\u201d During the past two\nor three days several cases have occurred of young children straying\nfrom home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath.",
        "In all these cases the children were too young to give any properly\nintelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses\nis that they had been with a \u201cbloofer lady.\u201d It has always been late\nin the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the\nchildren have not been found until early in the following morning.",
        "It\nis generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child\nmissed gave as his reason for being away that a \u201cbloofer lady\u201d had\nasked him to come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and\nused it as occasion served.",
        "This is the more natural as the favourite\ngame of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles.",
        "A correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending\nto be the \u201cbloofer lady\u201d is supremely funny.",
        "Some of our caricaturists\nmight, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing\nthe reality and the picture.",
        "It is only in accordance with general\nprinciples of human nature that the \u201cbloofer lady\u201d should be the popular\nr\u00f4le at these _al fresco_ performances.",
        "Our correspondent na\u00efvely\nsays that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as\nsome of these grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine\nthemselves--to be.",
        "There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some\nof the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been\nslightly torn or wounded in the throat.",
        "The wounds seem such as might\nbe made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance\nindividually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has\na system or method of its own.",
        "The police of the division have been\ninstructed to keep a sharp lookout for straying children, especially\nwhen very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog\nwhich may be about.",

        "Come, let us seek\nsomewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way.\u201d\n\nWe dined at \u201cJack Straw\u2019s Castle\u201d along with a little crowd of\nbicyclists and others who were genially noisy.",
        "About ten o\u2019clock we\nstarted from the inn.",
        "It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps\nmade the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual\nradius.",
        "The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for\nhe went on unhesitatingly; but as for me, I was in quite a mix-up\nas to locality.",
        "As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people,\ntill at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol\nof horse police going their usual suburban round.",
        "At last we reached\nthe wall of the churchyard, which we climbed over.",
        "With some little\ndifficulty--for it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange\nto us--we found the Westenra tomb.",
        "The Professor took the key, opened\nthe creaky door, and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously,\nmotioned me to precede him.",
        "There was a delicious irony in the offer,\nin the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion.",
        "My\ncompanion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after\ncarefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring\none.",
        "In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight.",
        "Then he\nfumbled in his bag, and taking out a match-box and a piece of candle,\nproceeded to make a light.",
        "The tomb in the daytime, and when wreathed\nwith fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now some\ndays afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites\nturning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the\nbeetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured\nstone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished\nbrass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a\ncandle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been\nimagined.",
        "It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was\nnot the only thing which could pass away.",
        "Van Helsing went about his work systematically.",
        "Holding his candle so\nthat he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm\ndropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he\nmade assurance of Lucy\u2019s coffin.",
        "Another search in his bag, and he took\nout a turnscrew.",
        "\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d I asked.",
        "\u201cTo open the coffin.",
        "You shall yet be convinced.\u201d Straightway he began\ntaking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the\ncasing of lead beneath.",
        "The sight was almost too much for me.",
        "It seemed\nto be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have\nstripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took\nhold of his hand to stop him.",
        "He only said: \u201cYou shall see,\u201d and again\nfumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw.",
        "Striking the turnscrew\nthrough the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he\nmade a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point\nof the saw.",
        "I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse.",
        "We\ndoctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to\nsuch things, and I drew back towards the door.",
        "But the Professor never\nstopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side\nof the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side.",
        "Taking\nthe edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the\ncoffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to\nlook.",
        "I drew near and looked.",
        "The coffin was empty.",
        "It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but\nVan Helsing was unmoved.",
        "He was now more sure than ever of his ground,\nand so emboldened to proceed in his task.",
        "\u201cAre you satisfied now, friend\nJohn?\u201d he asked.",
        "I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as\nI answered him:\n\n\u201cI am satisfied that Lucy\u2019s body is not in that coffin; but that only\nproves one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what is that, friend John?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat it is not there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is good logic,\u201d he said, \u201cso far as it goes.",
        "But how do you--how\ncan you--account for it not being there?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps a body-snatcher,\u201d I suggested.",
        "\u201cSome of the undertaker\u2019s people\nmay have stolen it.\u201d I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was\nthe only real cause which I could suggest.",
        "The Professor sighed.",
        "\u201cAh\nwell!\u201d he said, \u201cwe must have more proof.",
        "Come with me.\u201d\n\nHe put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed\nthem in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the\nbag.",
        "We opened the door, and went out.",
        "Behind us he closed the door and\nlocked it.",
        "He handed me the key, saying: \u201cWill you keep it?",
        "You had\nbetter be assured.\u201d I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am\nbound to say--as I motioned him to keep it.",
        "\u201cA key is nothing,\u201d I said;\n\u201cthere may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock\nof that kind.\u201d He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket.",
        "Then he\ntold me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he could watch\nat the other.",
        "I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark\nfigure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my\nsight.",
        "It was a lonely vigil.",
        "Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant\nclock strike twelve, and in time came one and two.",
        "I was chilled and\nunnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand\nand with myself for coming.",
        "I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly\nobservant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust; so altogether I had\na dreary, miserable time.",
        "Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white\nstreak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard\nfarthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the\nProfessor\u2019s side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it.",
        "Then\nI too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs,\nand I stumbled over graves.",
        "The sky was overcast, and somewhere far\noff an early cock crew.",
        "A little way off, beyond a line of scattered\njuniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim\nfigure flitted in the direction of the tomb.",
        "The tomb itself was hidden\nby trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared.",
        "I heard the\nrustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and\ncoming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child.",
        "When\nhe saw me he held it out to me, and said:--\n\n\u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.",
        "\u201cDo you not see the child?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it is a child, but who brought it here?",
        "And is it wounded?\u201d I\nasked.",
        "\u201cWe shall see,\u201d said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way\nout of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.",
        "When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of\ntrees, and struck a match, and looked at the child\u2019s throat.",
        "It was\nwithout a scratch or scar of any kind.",
        "\u201cWas I right?\u201d I asked triumphantly.",
        "\u201cWe were just in time,\u201d said the Professor thankfully.",
        "We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted\nabout it.",
        "If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to\ngive some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should\nhave had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.",
        "So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we\nheard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find\nit; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could.",
        "All fell out\nwell.",
        "At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman\u2019s heavy tramp,\nand laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until he saw\nit as he flashed his lantern to and fro.",
        "We heard his exclamation of\nastonishment, and then we went away silently.",
        "By good chance we got a\ncab near the \u201cSpaniards,\u201d and drove to town.",
        "I cannot sleep, so I make this entry.",
        "But I must try to get a few hours\u2019\nsleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon.",
        "He insists that I shall\ngo with him on another expedition.",
        "_27 September._--It was two o\u2019clock before we found a suitable\nopportunity for our attempt.",
        "The funeral held at noon was all completed,\nand the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily\naway, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we\nsaw the sexton lock the gate after him.",
        "We knew then that we were safe\ntill morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should\nnot want more than an hour at most.",
        "Again I felt that horrid sense\nof the reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed\nout of place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which\nwe were incurring in our unhallowed work.",
        "Besides, I felt it was all\nso useless.",
        "Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a\nwoman dead nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of\nfolly to open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own\neyesight, that the coffin was empty.",
        "I shrugged my shoulders, however,\nand rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,\nno matter who remonstrated.",
        "He took the key, opened the vault, and\nagain courteously motioned me to precede.",
        "The place was not so gruesome\nas last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine\nstreamed in.",
        "Van Helsing walked over to Lucy\u2019s coffin, and I followed.",
        "He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock\nof surprise and dismay shot through me.",
        "There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her\nfuneral.",
        "She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I\ncould not believe that she was dead.",
        "The lips were red, nay redder than\nbefore; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.",
        "\u201cIs this a juggle?\u201d I said to him.",
        "\u201cAre you convinced now?\u201d said the Professor in response, and as he spoke\nhe put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the\ndead lips and showed the white teeth.",
        "\u201cSee,\u201d he went on, \u201csee, they are even sharper than before.",
        "With this\nand this\u201d--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below\nit--\u201cthe little children can be bitten.",
        "Are you of belief now, friend\nJohn?\u201d Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me.",
        "I _could_ not\naccept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to\nargue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--\n\n\u201cShe may have been placed here since last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed?",
        "That is so, and by whom?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know.",
        "Some one has done it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet she has been dead one week.",
        "Most peoples in that time would not\nlook so.\u201d I had no answer for this, so was silent.",
        "Van Helsing did not\nseem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor\ntriumph.",
        "He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising\nthe eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and\nexamining the teeth.",
        "Then he turned to me and said:--\n\n\u201cHere, there is one thing which is different from all recorded: here is\nsome dual life that is not as the common.",
        "She was bitten by the vampire\nwhen she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know\nthat, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could\nhe best come to take more blood.",
        "In trance she died, and in trance she\nis Un-Dead, too.",
        "So it is that she differ from all other.",
        "Usually when\nthe Un-Dead sleep at home\u201d--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of\nhis arm to designate what to a vampire was \u201chome\u201d--\u201ctheir face show what\nthey are, but this so sweet that-was when she not Un-Dead she go back to\nthe nothings of the common dead.",
        "There is no malign there, see, and so\nit make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.\u201d This turned my blood\ncold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing\u2019s\ntheories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the\nidea of killing her?",
        "He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in\nmy face, for he said almost joyously:--\n\n\u201cAh, you believe now?\u201d\n\nI answered: \u201cDo not press me too hard all at once.",
        "I am willing to\naccept.",
        "How will you do this bloody work?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall\ndrive a stake through her body.\u201d It made me shudder to think of so\nmutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved.",
        "And yet the feeling\nwas not so strong as I had expected.",
        "I was, in fact, beginning to\nshudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing\ncalled it, and to loathe it.",
        "Is it possible that love is all subjective,\nor all objective?",
        "I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as\nif wrapped in thought.",
        "Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a\nsnap, and said:--\n\n\u201cI have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best.",
        "If\nI did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what\nis to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that\nare thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know.",
        "This is\nsimple.",
        "She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act\nnow would be to take danger from her for ever.",
        "But then we may have\nto want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this?",
        "If you, who saw the\nwounds on Lucy\u2019s throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child\u2019s\nat the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full\nto-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more\nbeautiful in a whole week after she die--if you know of this and know of\nthe white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,\nand yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect\nArthur, who know none of those things, to believe?",
        "He doubted me when\nI took him from her kiss when she was dying.",
        "I know he has forgiven me\nbecause in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say\ngood-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea\nthis woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have\nkilled her.",
        "He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that\nhave killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always.",
        "Yet he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all.",
        "And he will\nsometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint\nhis dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and, again, he\nwill think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,\nan Un-Dead.",
        "No!",
        "I told him once, and since then I learn much.",
        "Now, since\nI know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he\nmust pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet.",
        "He, poor fellow,\nmust have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to\nhim; then we can act for good all round and send him peace.",
        "My mind is\nmade up.",
        "Let us go.",
        "You return home for to-night to your asylum, and\nsee that all be well.",
        "As for me, I shall spend the night here in this\nchurchyard in my own way.",
        "To-morrow night you will come to me to the\nBerkeley Hotel at ten of the clock.",
        "I shall send for Arthur to come too,\nand also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood.",
        "Later\nwe shall all have work to do.",
        "I come with you so far as Piccadilly and\nthere dine, for I must be back here before the sun set.\u201d\n\nSo we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the\nchurchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.",
        "_Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel, directed\nto John Seward, M.D._\n\n(Not delivered.)",
        "\u201c_27 September._\n\n\u201cFriend John,--\n\n\u201cI write this in case anything should happen.",
        "I go alone to watch in\nthat churchyard.",
        "It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall\nnot leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more\neager.",
        "Therefore I shall fix some things she like not--garlic and a\ncrucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb.",
        "She is young as Un-Dead,\nand will heed.",
        "Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out;\nthey may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is\ndesperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may\nbe.",
        "I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise,\nand if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it.",
        "For Miss\nLucy, or from her, I have no fear: but that other to whom is there that\nshe is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.",
        "He is cunning, as I know from Mr.",
        "Jonathan and from the way that all\nalong he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy\u2019s life, and\nwe lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong.",
        "He have always the\nstrength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength\nto Miss Lucy it also is all to him.",
        "Besides, he can summon his wolf\nand I know not what.",
        "So if it be that he come thither on this night he\nshall find me; but none other shall--until it be too late.",
        "But it may be\nthat he will not attempt the place.",
        "There is no reason why he should;\nhis hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the\nUn-Dead woman sleep, and one old man watch.",
        "\u201cTherefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this,\nthe diaries of Harker and the rest, and read them, and then find this\ngreat Un-Dead, and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake\nthough it, so that the world may rest from him.",
        "\u201cIf it be so, farewell.",

        "Seward\u2019s Diary._\n\n_28 September._--It is wonderful what a good night\u2019s sleep will do for\none.",
        "Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing\u2019s monstrous\nideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on\ncommon sense.",
        "I have no doubt that he believes it all.",
        "I wonder if his\nmind can have become in any way unhinged.",
        "Surely there must be _some_\nrational explanation of all these mysterious things.",
        "Is it possible that\nthe Professor can have done it himself?",
        "He is so abnormally clever that\nif he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to\nsome fixed idea in a wonderful way.",
        "I am loath to think it, and indeed\nit would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van\nHelsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully.",
        "I may get some\nlight on the mystery.",
        "_29 September, morning_.... Last night, at a little before ten o\u2019clock,\nArthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing\u2019s room; he told us all what he\nwanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all\nour wills were centred in his.",
        "He began by saying that he hoped we would\nall come with him too, \u201cfor,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is a grave duty to be\ndone there.",
        "You were doubtless surprised at my letter?\u201d This query was\ndirectly addressed to Lord Godalming.",
        "\u201cI was.",
        "It rather upset me for a bit.",
        "There has been so much trouble\naround my house of late that I could do without any more.",
        "I have been\ncurious, too, as to what you mean.",
        "Quincey and I talked it over; but the\nmore we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself\nthat I\u2019m about up a tree as to any meaning about anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe, too,\u201d said Quincey Morris laconically.",
        "\u201cOh,\u201d said the Professor, \u201cthen you are nearer the beginning, both of\nyou, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can\neven get so far as to begin.\u201d\n\nIt was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of\nmind without my saying a word.",
        "Then, turning to the other two, he said\nwith intense gravity:--\n\n\u201cI want your permission to do what I think good this night.",
        "It is, I\nknow, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will\nknow, and only then, how much.",
        "Therefore may I ask that you promise me\nin the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for\na time--I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may\nbe--you shall not blame yourselves for anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s frank anyhow,\u201d broke in Quincey.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll answer for the Professor.",
        "I don\u2019t quite see his drift, but I swear he\u2019s honest; and that\u2019s good\nenough for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank you, sir,\u201d said Van Helsing proudly.",
        "\u201cI have done myself the\nhonour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear\nto me.\u201d He held out a hand, which Quincey took.",
        "Then Arthur spoke out:--\n\n\u201cDr.",
        "Van Helsing, I don\u2019t quite like to \u2018buy a pig in a poke,\u2019 as they\nsay in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman\nor my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.",
        "If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of\nthese two, then I give my consent at once; though, for the life of me, I\ncannot understand what you are driving at.\u201d\n\n\u201cI accept your limitation,\u201d said Van Helsing, \u201cand all I ask of you\nis that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will\nfirst consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your\nreservations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed!\u201d said Arthur; \u201cthat is only fair.",
        "And now that the\n_pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at\nKingstead.\u201d\n\nArthur\u2019s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--\n\n\u201cWhere poor Lucy is buried?\u201d The Professor bowed.",
        "Arthur went on: \u201cAnd\nwhen there?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo enter the tomb!\u201d Arthur stood up.",
        "\u201cProfessor, are you in earnest; or is it some monstrous joke?",
        "Pardon\nme, I see that you are in earnest.\u201d He sat down again, but I could see\nthat he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity.",
        "There was\nsilence until he asked again:--\n\n\u201cAnd when in the tomb?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo open the coffin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is too much!\u201d he said, angrily rising again.",
        "\u201cI am willing to be\npatient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecration\nof the grave--of one who----\u201d He fairly choked with indignation.",
        "The\nProfessor looked pityingly at him.",
        "\u201cIf I could spare you one pang, my poor friend,\u201d he said, \u201cGod knows I\nwould.",
        "But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and\nfor ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!\u201d\n\nArthur looked up with set, white face and said:--\n\n\u201cTake care, sir, take care!\u201d\n\n\u201cWould it not be well to hear what I have to say?\u201d said Van Helsing.",
        "\u201cAnd then you will at least know the limit of my purpose.",
        "Shall I go\non?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair enough,\u201d broke in Morris.",
        "After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--\n\n\u201cMiss Lucy is dead; is it not so?",
        "Yes!",
        "Then there can be no wrong to\nher.",
        "But if she be not dead----\u201d\n\nArthur jumped to his feet.",
        "\u201cGood God!\u201d he cried.",
        "\u201cWhat do you mean?",
        "Has there been any mistake; has\nshe been buried alive?\u201d He groaned in anguish that not even hope could\nsoften.",
        "\u201cI did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it.",
        "I go no\nfurther than to say that she might be Un-Dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cUn-Dead!",
        "Not alive!",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Is this all a nightmare, or what\nis it?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they\nmay solve only in part.",
        "Believe me, we are now on the verge of one.",
        "But\nI have not done.",
        "May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?\u201d\n\n\u201cHeavens and earth, no!\u201d cried Arthur in a storm of passion.",
        "\u201cNot for\nthe wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body.",
        "Dr.",
        "Van Helsing, you try me too far.",
        "What have I done to you that you should\ntorture me so?",
        "What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to\ncast such dishonour on her grave?",
        "Are you mad that speak such things,\nor am I mad that listen to them?",
        "Don\u2019t dare to think more of such a\ndesecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do.",
        "I have a\nduty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do\nit!\u201d\n\nVan Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and\nsaid, gravely and sternly:--\n\n\u201cMy Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a\nduty to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it!",
        "All I ask\nyou now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if\nwhen later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its\nfulfilment even than I am, then--then I shall do my duty, whatever it\nmay seem to me.",
        "And then, to follow of your Lordship\u2019s wishes, I shall\nhold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where\nyou will.\u201d His voice broke a little, and he went on with an accent full\nof pity:--\n\n\u201cBut, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me.",
        "In a long life of\nacts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring\nmy heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now.",
        "Believe me that if\nthe time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from you\nwill wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can to\nsave you from sorrow.",
        "Just think.",
        "For why should I give myself so much\nof labour and so much of sorrow?",
        "I have come here from my own land to\ndo what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and then\nto help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love.",
        "For her--I am\nashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you gave:\nthe blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her lover,\nbut only her physician and her friend.",
        "I gave to her my nights and\ndays--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good even\nnow, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.\u201d He said\nthis with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected by it.",
        "He took the old man\u2019s hand and said in a broken voice:--\n\n\u201cOh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I\nwill go with you and wait.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.",
        "/Dr.",
        "Seward\u2019s Diary/--_continued._\n\n\nIt was just a quarter before twelve o\u2019clock when we got into the\nchurchyard over the low wall.",
        "The night was dark, with occasional\ngleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded\nacross the sky.",
        "We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing\nslightly in front as he led the way.",
        "When we had come close to the tomb\nI looked well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place\nladen with so sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself\nwell.",
        "I took it that the very mystery of the proceeding tended in some\nway a counteractent to his grief.",
        "The Professor unlocked the door, and\nseeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the\ndifficulty by entering first himself.",
        "The rest of us followed, and he\nclosed the door.",
        "He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin.",
        "Arthur stepped forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--\n\n\u201cYou were with me here yesterday.",
        "Was the body of Miss Lucy in that\ncoffin?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was.\u201d The Professor turned to the rest, saying:--\n\n\u201cYou hear; and yet there is one who does not believe with me.\u201d He\ntook his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin.",
        "Arthur\nlooked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped\nforward.",
        "He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,\nat any rate, had not thought of it.",
        "When he saw the rent in the lead,\nthe blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away\nagain, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.",
        "Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and\nrecoiled.",
        "The coffin was empty!",
        "For several minutes no one spoke a word.",
        "The silence was broken by\nQuincey Morris:--\n\n\u201cProfessor, I answered for you.",
        "Your word is all I want.",
        "I wouldn\u2019t\nask such a thing ordinarily--I wouldn\u2019t so dishonour you as to imply a\ndoubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.",
        "Is this your doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor\ntouched her.",
        "What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and\nI came here--with good purpose, believe me.",
        "I opened that coffin, which\nwas then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty.",
        "We then waited, and\nsaw something white come through the trees.",
        "The next day we came here in\ndaytime, and she lay there.",
        "Did she not, friend John?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat night we were just in time.",
        "One more so small child was missing,\nand we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves.",
        "Yesterday I came\nhere before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move.",
        "I waited here\nall the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing.",
        "It was most probable\nthat it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,\nwhich the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun.",
        "Last\nnight there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away\nmy garlic and other things.",
        "And so it is we find this coffin empty.",
        "But\nbear with me.",
        "So far there is much that is strange.",
        "Wait you with me\noutside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.",
        "So\u201d--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--\u201cnow to the outside.\u201d\nHe opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the\ndoor behind him.",
        "Oh!",
        "but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror\nof that vault.",
        "How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the\nbrief gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and\npassing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man\u2019s life; how sweet it\nwas to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay;\nhow humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and\nto hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city.",
        "Each in his own way was solemn and overcome.",
        "Arthur was silent, and\nwas, I could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning\nof the mystery.",
        "I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again\nto throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing\u2019s conclusions.",
        "Quincey\nMorris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and\naccepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has\nto stake.",
        "Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug\nof tobacco and began to chew.",
        "As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a\ndefinite way.",
        "First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like\nthin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white\nnapkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like\ndough or putty.",
        "He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the\nmass between his hands.",
        "This he then took, and rolling it into thin\nstrips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its\nsetting in the tomb.",
        "I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,\nasked him what it was that he was doing.",
        "Arthur and Quincey drew near\nalso, as they too were curious.",
        "He answered:--\n\n\u201cI am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd is that stuff you have put there going to do it?\u201d asked Quincey.",
        "\u201cGreat Scott!",
        "Is this a game?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that which you are using?\u201d This time the question was by\nArthur.",
        "Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--\n\n\u201cThe Host.",
        "I brought it from Amsterdam.",
        "I have an Indulgence.\u201d It was an\nanswer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually\nthat in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor\u2019s, a\npurpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it\nwas impossible to distrust.",
        "In respectful silence we took the places\nassigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any\none approaching.",
        "I pitied the others, especially Arthur.",
        "I had myself\nbeen apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet\nI, who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink\nwithin me.",
        "Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress,\nor yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did\ntree or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so\nmysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a\nwoeful presage through the night.",
        "There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from\nthe Professor a keen \u201cS-s-s-s!\u201d He pointed; and far down the avenue\nof yews we saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held\nsomething dark at its breast.",
        "The figure stopped, and at the moment a\nray of moonlight fell between the masses of driving clouds and showed in\nstartling prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of\nthe grave.",
        "We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we\nsaw to be a fair-haired child.",
        "There was a pause and a sharp little cry,\nsuch as a child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and\ndreams.",
        "We were starting forward, but the Professor\u2019s warning hand, seen\nby us as he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked\nthe white figure moved forwards again.",
        "It was now near enough for us to\nsee clearly, and the moonlight still held.",
        "My own heart grew cold as\nice, and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features\nof Lucy Westenra.",
        "Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed.",
        "The sweetness was\nturned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous\nwantonness.",
        "Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we\nall advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of\nthe tomb.",
        "Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the\nconcentrated light that fell on Lucy\u2019s face we could see that the lips\nwere crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her\nchin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.",
        "We shuddered with horror.",
        "I could see by the tremulous light that even\nVan Helsing\u2019s iron nerve had failed.",
        "Arthur was next to me, and if I had\nnot seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.",
        "When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her\nshape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives\nwhen taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us.",
        "Lucy\u2019s eyes in form\nand colour; but Lucy\u2019s eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of\nthe pure, gentle orbs we knew.",
        "At that moment the remnant of my love\npassed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have\ndone it with savage delight.",
        "As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy\nlight, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile.",
        "Oh, God,\nhow it made me shudder to see it!",
        "With a careless motion, she flung\nto the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had\nclutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls\nover a bone.",
        "The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning.",
        "There\nwas a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when\nshe advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile, he fell\nback and hid his face in his hands.",
        "She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,\nsaid:--\n\n\u201cCome to me, Arthur.",
        "Leave these others and come to me.",
        "My arms are\nhungry for you.",
        "Come, and we can rest together.",
        "Come, my husband, come!\u201d\n\nThere was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the\ntingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us\nwho heard the words addressed to another.",
        "As for Arthur, he seemed under\na spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms.",
        "She\nwas leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between\nthem his little golden crucifix.",
        "She recoiled from it, and, with a\nsuddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter\nthe tomb.",
        "When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped as if\narrested by some irresistible force.",
        "Then she turned, and her face was\nshown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now\nno quiver from Van Helsing\u2019s iron nerves.",
        "Never did I see such baffled\nmalice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again\nby mortal eyes.",
        "The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to\nthrow out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the\nfolds of the flesh were the coils of Medusa\u2019s snakes, and the lovely,\nblood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of\nthe Greeks and Japanese.",
        "If ever a face meant death--if looks could\nkill--we saw it at that moment.",
        "And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained\nbetween the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of\nentry.",
        "Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--\n\n\u201cAnswer me, oh my friend!",
        "Am I to proceed in my work?\u201d\n\nArthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he\nanswered:--\n\n\u201cDo as you will, friend; do as you will.",
        "There can be no horror\nlike this ever any more!\u201d and he groaned in spirit.",
        "Quincey and I\nsimultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms.",
        "We could hear\nthe click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming\nclose to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the\nsacred emblem which he had placed there.",
        "We all looked on in horrified\namazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal\nbody as real at the moment as our own, pass in through the interstice\nwhere scarce a knife-blade could have gone.",
        "We all felt a glad sense of\nrelief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty\nto the edges of the door.",
        "When this was done, he lifted the child and said:--\n\n\u201cCome now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow.",
        "There is a\nfuneral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that.",
        "The\nfriends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock\nthe gate we shall remain.",
        "Then there is more to do; but not like this of\nto-night.",
        "As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow\nnight he shall be well.",
        "We shall leave him where the police will find\nhim, as on the other night; and then to home.\u201d Coming close to Arthur,\nhe said:--\n\n\u201cMy friend Arthur, you have had sore trial; but after, when you will\nlook back, you will see how it was necessary.",
        "You are now in the\nbitter waters, my child.",
        "By this time tomorrow, you will, please God,\nhave passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn\novermuch.",
        "Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.\u201d\n\nArthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other\non the way.",
        "We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all\nslept with more or less reality of sleep.",
        "_29 September, night._--A little before twelve o\u2019clock we three--Arthur,\nQuincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor.",
        "It was odd to\nnotice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes.",
        "Of\ncourse, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of\nus wore it by instinct.",
        "We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and\nstrolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the\ngravediggers had completed their task, and the sexton, under the belief\nthat everyone had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to\nourselves.",
        "Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a\nlong leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of\nfair weight.",
        "When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up\nthe road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the\nProfessor to the tomb.",
        "He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing\nit behind us.",
        "Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and\nalso two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their\nown ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient\nto work by.",
        "When he again lifted the lid off Lucy\u2019s coffin we all\nlooked--Arthur trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there\nin all its death-beauty.",
        "But there was no love in my own heart, nothing\nbut loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy\u2019s shape without her\nsoul.",
        "I could see even Arthur\u2019s face grow hard as he looked.",
        "Presently\nhe said to Van Helsing:--\n\n\u201cIs this really Lucy\u2019s body, or only a demon in her shape?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is her body, and yet not it.",
        "But wait a while, and you shall see her\nas she was, and is.\u201d\n\nShe seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed\nteeth, the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder\nto see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like\na devilish mockery of Lucy\u2019s sweet purity.",
        "Van Helsing, in his\nmethodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and\nplacing them ready for use.",
        "First he took out a soldering iron and some\nplumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in\na corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame;\nthen his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a round\nwooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about three\nfeet long.",
        "One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and was\nsharpened to a fine point.",
        "With this stake came a heavy hammer, such\nas in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps.",
        "To\nme, a doctor\u2019s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and\nbracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was\nto cause them a sort of consternation.",
        "They both, however, kept their\ncourage, and remained silent and quiet.",
        "When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--\n\n\u201cBefore we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and\nexperience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers\nof the Un-Dead.",

        "To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better\nright?",
        "Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the\nnight when sleep is not: \u2018It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it\nwas the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would\nherself have chosen, had it been to her to choose\u2019?",
        "Tell me if there be\nsuch a one amongst us.\u201d\n\nWe all looked at Arthur.",
        "He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite\nkindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore\nLucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and\nsaid bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as\nsnow:--\n\n\u201cMy true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you.",
        "Tell me\nwhat I am to do, and I shall not falter!\u201d Van Helsing laid a hand on his\nshoulder, and said:--\n\n\u201cBrave lad!",

        "This stake must be\ndriven through her.",
        "It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived in\nthat--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more\nthan your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though\nyou tread on air.",
        "But you must not falter when once you have begun.",
        "Only\nthink that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for\nyou all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on,\u201d said Arthur hoarsely.",
        "\u201cTell me what I am to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the\nheart, and the hammer in your right.",
        "Then when we begin our prayer for\nthe dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall\nfollow--strike in God\u2019s name, that so all may be well with the dead that\nwe love, and that the Un-Dead pass away.\u201d\n\nArthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on\naction his hands never trembled nor even quivered.",
        "Van Helsing opened\nhis missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we\ncould.",
        "Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could\nsee its dint in the white flesh.",
        "Then he struck with all his might.",
        "The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech\ncame from the opened red lips.",
        "The body shook and quivered and twisted\nin wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the\nlips were cut and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam.",
        "But Arthur\nnever faltered.",
        "He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm\nrose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst\nthe blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it.",
        "His\nface was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it\ngave us courage, so that our voices seemed to ring through the little\nvault.",
        "And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the\nteeth ceased to champ, and the face to quiver.",

        "Great drops of sweat sprang out on his forehead, and\nhis breath came in broken gasps.",
        "It had indeed been an awful strain\non him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human\nconsiderations he could never have gone through with it.",
        "For a few\nminutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the\ncoffin.",
        "When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one\nto the other of us.",
        "We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had\nbeen seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,\nstrange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of\nhorror that lay upon it.",
        "There in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded\nand grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a\nprivilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in\nher life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity.",
        "True that\nthere was there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and\npain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth\nto what we knew.",
        "One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like\nsunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and\nsymbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.",
        "Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur\u2019s shoulder, and said to\nhim:--\n\n\u201cAnd now, Arthur, my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?\u201d\n\nThe reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man\u2019s hand\nin his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--\n\n\u201cForgiven!",
        "God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,\nand me peace.\u201d He put his hands on the Professor\u2019s shoulder, and laying\nhis head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood\nunmoving.",
        "When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--\n\n\u201cAnd now, my child, you may kiss her.",
        "Kiss her dead lips if you will, as\nshe would have you to, if for her to choose.",
        "For she is not a grinning\ndevil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity.",

        "She is God\u2019s true dead, whose soul is with Him!\u201d\n\nArthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the\ntomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point\nof it in the body.",
        "Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with\ngarlic.",
        "We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid, and\ngathering up our belongings, came away.",
        "When the Professor locked the\ndoor he gave the key to Arthur.",
        "Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it\nseemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch.",
        "There was\ngladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves\non one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.",
        "Before we moved away Van Helsing said:--\n\n\u201cNow, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing\nto ourselves.",
        "But there remains a greater task: to find out the author\nof all this our sorrow and to stamp him out.",

        "I suppose there is something in woman\u2019s nature\nthat makes a man free to break down before her and express his feelings\non the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his\nmanhood; for when Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down\non the sofa and gave way utterly and openly.",
        "I sat down beside him and\ntook his hand.",

        "It seemed\nto me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a\nvent at once.",
        "He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat\nhis palms together in a perfect agony of grief.",
        "He stood up and then sat\ndown again, and the tears rained down his cheeks.",
        "I felt an infinite\npity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly.",
        "With a sob he laid his\nhead on my shoulder, and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook\nwith emotion.",
        "We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above\nsmaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big,\nsorrowing man\u2019s head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby\nthat some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he\nwere my own child.",
        "I never thought at the time how strange it all was.",
        "After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an\napology, though he made no disguise of his emotion.",
        "He told me that\nfor days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had\nbeen unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of\nsorrow.",
        "There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with\nwhom, owing to the terrible circumstances with which his sorrow was\nsurrounded, he could speak freely.",

        "\u201cAy, and for your\nown sake,\u201d he added, \u201cfor if a man\u2019s esteem and gratitude are ever worth\nthe winning, you have won mine to-day.",

        "God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the\nsunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you\nwill let me know.\u201d He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that\nI felt it would comfort him, so I said:--\n\n\u201cI promise.\u201d\n\nAs I came along the corridor I saw Mr.",

        "I saw the\nmanuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise\nhow much I knew; so I said to him:--\n\n\u201cI wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart.",
        "Will you let me\nbe your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it?",
        "You\nwill know, later on, why I speak.\u201d He saw that I was in earnest, and\nstooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it.",
        "It seemed\nbut poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I\nbent over and kissed him.",
        "The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a\nmomentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--\n\n\u201cLittle girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long\nas ever you live!\u201d Then he went into the study to his friend.",

        "When I went into the room, I told the man that a\nlady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,\u201d I\nanswered.",
        "\u201cOh, very well,\u201d he said: \u201clet her come in, by all means; but\njust wait a minute till I tidy up the place.\u201d His method of tidying was\npeculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes\nbefore I could stop him.",
        "It was quite evident that he feared, or was\njealous of, some interference.",
        "When he had got through his disgusting\ntask, he said cheerfully: \u201cLet the lady come in,\u201d and sat down on the\nedge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that\nhe could see her as she entered.",
        "For a moment I thought that he might\nhave some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just\nbefore he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where\nI could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her.",
        "She\ncame into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command\nthe respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad\npeople most respect.",

        "Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--\n\n\u201cHow did you know I wanted to marry any one?\u201d His reply was simply\ncontemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.",

        "Since I\nmyself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I cannot but notice\nthat the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the\nerrors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_.\u201d I positively opened my\neyes at this new development.",
        "Here was my own pet lunatic--the most\npronounced of his type that I had ever met with--talking elemental\nphilosophy, and with the manner of a polished gentleman.",
        "I wonder if it\nwas Mrs.",
        "Harker\u2019s presence which had touched some chord in his memory.",
        "If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any way due to her unconscious\ninfluence, she must have some rare gift or power.",
        "We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly\nquite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she\nbegan, to lead him to his favourite topic.",
        "I was again astonished,\nfor he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the\ncompletest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned\ncertain things.",
        "\u201cWhy, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief.",
        "Indeed,\nit was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my\nbeing put under control.",
        "I used to fancy that life was a positive and\nperpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no\nmatter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong\nlife.",
        "At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to\ntake human life.",
        "The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion\nI tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers\nby the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of\nhis blood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, \u2018For the\nblood is the life.\u2019 Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has\nvulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt.",
        "Isn\u2019t that true,\ndoctor?\u201d I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what I\nought to think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat\nup his spiders and flies not five minutes before.",
        "Looking at my watch,\nI saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told\nMrs.",
        "Harker that it was time to leave.",
        "She came at once, after saying\npleasantly to Mr.",
        "Renfield: \u201cGood-bye, and I hope I may see you often,\nunder auspices pleasanter to yourself,\u201d to which, to my astonishment, he\nreplied:--\n\n\u201cGood-bye, my dear.",

        "He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--\n\n\u201cAh, friend John, how goes all?",

        "Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help\nto us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible\naffair.",

        "You tell me she has wrote all, then\nshe must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work,\nand we go alone.\u201d I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what\nwe had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was\nthe very next one to my own.",
        "He was amazed, and a great concern seemed\nto come on him.",
        "\u201cOh that we had known it before!\u201d he said, \u201cfor then we\nmight have reached him in time to save poor Lucy.",

        "We shall not think\nof that, but go on our way to the end.\u201d Then he fell into a silence that\nlasted till we entered my own gateway.",
        "Before we went to prepare for\ndinner he said to Mrs.",
        "Harker:--\n\n\u201cI am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have\nput up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot up to this moment, Professor,\u201d she said impulsively, \u201cbut up to\nthis morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why not up to now?",

        "I too have seen the need of putting down at\npresent everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except\nwhat is personal.",
        "Must it go in?\u201d The Professor read it over gravely,\nand handed it back, saying:--\n\n\u201cIt need not go in if you do not wish it; but pray that it may.",
        "It can\nbut make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more\nhonour you--as well as more esteem and love.\u201d She took it back with\nanother blush and a bright smile.",

        "I shall then make known to you\nsomething of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for\nme.",

        "Van Helsing\nwent on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work\nhad begun.",
        "It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,\nas any other transaction of life:--\n\n\u201cWell, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not\nwithout strength.",
        "We have on our side power of combination--a power\ndenied to the vampire kind; we have resources of science; we are free\nto act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours\nequally.",
        "In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and\nwe are free to use them.",
        "We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to\nachieve which is not a selfish one.",
        "These things are much.",
        "\u201cNow let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are\nrestrict, and how the individual cannot.",

        "\u201cAll we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions.",
        "These do\nnot at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and\ndeath--nay of more than either life or death.",
        "Yet must we be satisfied;\nin the first place because we have to be--no other means is at our\ncontrol--and secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and\nsuperstition--are everything.",
        "Does not the belief in vampires rest\nfor others--though not, alas!",
        "for us--on them?",
        "A year ago which of us\nwould have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,\nsceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century?",
        "We even scouted a belief\nthat we saw justified under our very eyes.",
        "Take it, then, that the\nvampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the\nmoment on the same base.",
        "For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere\nthat men have been.",
        "In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany\nall over, in France, in India, even in the Chersonese; and in China,\nso far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him\nat this day.",
        "He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the\ndevil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar.",
        "So far, then,\nwe have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of\nthe beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy\nexperience.",
        "The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of\nthe time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of\nthe living.",
        "Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow\nyounger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though\nthey refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty.",
        "But he\ncannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others.",
        "Even friend\nJonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!",
        "He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again Jonathan\nobserve.",
        "He has the strength of many in his hand--witness again\nJonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him\nfrom the diligence too.",
        "He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather\nfrom the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as\nbat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John\nsaw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at\nthe window of Miss Lucy.",
        "He can come in mist which he create--that noble\nship\u2019s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance\nhe can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself.",
        "He\ncome on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those\nsisters in the castle of Dracula.",
        "He become so small--we ourselves saw\nMiss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hair-breadth space at\nthe tomb door.",
        "He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything\nor into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up\nwith fire--solder you call it.",
        "He can see in the dark--no small power\nthis, in a world which is one half shut from the light.",
        "Ah, but hear\nme through.",
        "He can do all these things, yet he is not free.",
        "Nay; he is\neven more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his\ncell.",
        "He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to\nobey some of nature\u2019s laws--why we know not.",
        "He may not enter anywhere\nat the first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to\ncome; though afterwards he can come as he please.",
        "His power ceases, as\ndoes that of all evil things, at the coming of the day.",
        "Only at certain\ntimes can he have limited freedom.",
        "If he be not at the place whither\nhe is bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise\nor sunset.",
        "These things are we told, and in this record of ours we\nhave proof by inference.",
        "Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his\nlimit, when he have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the\nplace unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at\nWhitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come.",
        "It is\nsaid, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood\nof the tide.",
        "Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no\npower, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this\nsymbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to\nthem he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and\nsilent with respect.",
        "There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,\nlest in our seeking we may need them.",
        "The branch of wild rose on his\ncoffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the\ncoffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through\nhim, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.",
        "We have seen it with our eyes.",
        "\u201cThus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine\nhim to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know.",
        "But he is\nclever.",
        "I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to\nmake his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what\nhe has been.",
        "He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won\nhis name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of\nTurkey-land.",
        "If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,\nand for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the\nmost cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the \u2018land beyond\nthe forest.\u2019 That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him\nto his grave, and are even now arrayed against us.",
        "The Draculas were,\nsays Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions\nwho were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One.",
        "They learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains\nover Lake Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his\ndue.",
        "In the records are such words as \u2018stregoica\u2019--witch, \u2018ordog,\u2019 and\n\u2018pokol\u2019--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is\nspoken of as \u2018wampyr,\u2019 which we all understand too well.",
        "There have been\nfrom the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their\ngraves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell.",
        "For it\nis not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in\nall good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest.\u201d\n\nWhilst they were talking Mr.",
        "Morris was looking steadily at the window,\nand he now got up quietly, and went out of the room.",
        "There was a little\npause, and then the Professor went on:--\n\n\u201cAnd now we must settle what we do.",
        "We have here much data, and we must\nproceed to lay out our campaign.",
        "We know from the inquiry of Jonathan\nthat from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which\nwere delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these\nboxes have been removed.",
        "It seems to me, that our first step should be\nto ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall\nwhere we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed.",
        "If the\nlatter, we must trace----\u201d\n\nHere we were interrupted in a very startling way.",
        "Outside the house came\nthe sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with\na bullet, which, ricocheting from the top of the embrasure, struck the\nfar wall of the room.",
        "I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked\nout.",
        "The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the\nwindow and threw up the sash.",
        "As he did so we heard Mr.",
        "Morris\u2019s voice\nwithout:--\n\n\u201cSorry!",
        "I fear I have alarmed you.",
        "I shall come in and tell you about\nit.\u201d A minute later he came in and said:--\n\n\u201cIt was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.",
        "Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly.",
        "But the fact is that while the Professor was talking there came a big\nbat and sat on the window-sill.",
        "I have got such a horror of the damned\nbrutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to\nhave a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings whenever I have\nseen one.",
        "You used to laugh at me for it then, Art.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you hit it?\u201d asked Dr.",
        "Van Helsing.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood.\u201d Without\nsaying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his\nstatement:--\n\n\u201cWe must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must\neither capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to\nspeak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.",
        "Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of\nnoon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.",
        "\u201cAnd now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.",
        "You are too precious to us to have such risk.",
        "When we part to-night,\nyou no more must question.",
        "We shall tell you all in good time.",
        "We are\nmen, and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we\nshall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we\nare.\u201d\n\nAll the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to\nme good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their\nsafety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but their\nminds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,\nI could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.",
        "Mr.",
        "Morris resumed the discussion:--\n\n\u201cAs there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right\nnow.",
        "Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save\nanother victim.\u201d\n\nI own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so\nclose, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I\nappeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave\nme out of their counsels altogether.",
        "They have now gone off to Carfax,\nwith means to get into the house.",
        "Manlike, they have told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can\nsleep when those she loves are in danger!",

        "Seward\u2019s Diary_\n\n_1 October, 4 a.m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, an urgent\nmessage was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see him at\nonce, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.",
        "I told\nthe messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the morning; I\nwas busy just at the moment.",
        "The attendant added:--\n\n\u201cHe seems very importunate, sir.",
        "I have never seen him so eager.",
        "I\ndon\u2019t know but what, if you don\u2019t see him soon, he will have one of his\nviolent fits.\u201d I knew the man would not have said this without some\ncause, so I said: \u201cAll right; I\u2019ll go now;\u201d and I asked the others to\nwait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my \u201cpatient.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake me with you, friend John,\u201d said the Professor.",
        "\u201cHis case in your\ndiary interested me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on\n_our_ case.",
        "I should much like to see him, and especially when his mind\nis disturbed.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay I come also?\u201d asked Lord Godalming.",
        "\u201cMe too?\u201d said Quincey Morris.",
        "I nodded, and we all went down the\npassage together.",
        "We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more\nrational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him.",
        "There was\nan unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had\never met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons\nwould prevail with others entirely sane.",
        "We all four went into the room,\nbut none of the others at first said anything.",
        "His request was that I\nwould at once release him from the asylum and send him home.",
        "This he\nbacked up with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced\nhis own existing sanity.",
        "\u201cI appeal to your friends,\u201d he said; \u201cthey\nwill, perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case.",
        "By the way, you\nhave not introduced me.\u201d I was so much astonished, that the oddness\nof introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment;\nand, besides, there was a certain dignity in the man\u2019s manner, so much\nof the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: \u201cLord\nGodalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr.",
        "Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.",
        "Renfield.\u201d He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--\n\n\u201cLord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the\nWindham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no\nmore.",
        "He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in\nhis youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much\npatronised on Derby night.",
        "Mr.",
        "Morris, you should be proud of your great\nstate.",
        "Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have\nfar-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold\nallegiance to the Stars and Stripes.",
        "The power of Treaty may yet prove\na vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true\nplace as a political fable.",
        "What shall any man say of his pleasure at\nmeeting Van Helsing?",
        "Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of\nconventional prefix.",
        "When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics\nby his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,\nconventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him\nto one of a class.",
        "You gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or\nby the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective\nplaces in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at\nleast the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.",
        "And I am sure that you, Dr.",
        "Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as\nwell as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to\nbe considered as under exceptional circumstances.\u201d He made this last\nappeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own\ncharm.",
        "I think we were all staggered.",
        "For my own part, I was under the\nconviction, despite my knowledge of the man\u2019s character and history,\nthat his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse\nto tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about\nthe necessary formalities for his release in the morning.",
        "I thought it\nbetter to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old\nI knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.",
        "So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared\nto be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him\nin the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction\nof meeting his wishes.",
        "This did not at all satisfy him, for he said\nquickly:--\n\n\u201cBut I fear, Dr.",
        "Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish.",
        "I desire\nto go at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may.",
        "Time presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it\nis of the essence of the contract.",
        "I am sure it is only necessary to\nput before so admirable a practitioner as Dr.",
        "Seward so simple, yet so\nmomentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment.\u201d He looked at me keenly, and\nseeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised\nthem closely.",
        "Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--\n\n\u201cIs it possible that I have erred in my supposition?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have,\u201d I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.",
        "There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--\n\n\u201cThen I suppose I must only shift my ground of request.",
        "Let me ask\nfor this concession--boon, privilege, what you will.",
        "I am content to\nimplore in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of\nothers.",
        "I am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but\nyou may, I assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound\nand unselfish, and springing from the highest sense of duty.",
        "Could you\nlook, sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments\nwhich animate me.",
        "Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and\ntruest of your friends.\u201d Again he looked at us all keenly.",
        "I had a\ngrowing conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual\nmethod was but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so\ndetermined to let him go on a little longer, knowing from experience\nthat he would, like all lunatics, give himself away in the end.",
        "Van\nHelsing was gazing at him with a look of the utmost intensity, his bushy\neyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his look.",
        "He\nsaid to Renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time, but\nonly when I thought of it afterwards--for it was as of one addressing an\nequal:--\n\n\u201cCan you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free\nto-night?",
        "I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,\nwithout prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr.",
        "Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility,\nthe privilege you seek.\u201d He shook his head sadly, and with a look of\npoignant regret on his face.",
        "The Professor went on:--\n\n\u201cCome sir, bethink yourself.",
        "You claim the privilege of reason in\nthe highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete\nreasonableness.",
        "You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since\nyou are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect.",
        "If\nyou will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can\nwe perform the duty which you yourself put upon us?",
        "Be wise, and help\nus; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish.\u201d He still shook\nhis head as he said:--\n\n\u201cDr.",
        "Van Helsing, I have nothing to say.",
        "Your argument is complete, and\nif I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not\nmy own master in the matter.",
        "I can only ask you to trust me.",
        "If I am\nrefused, the responsibility does not rest with me.\u201d I thought it was now\ntime to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went\ntowards the door, simply saying:--\n\n\u201cCome, my friends, we have work to do.",
        "Good-night.\u201d\n\nAs, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient.",
        "He moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he\nwas about to make another homicidal attack.",
        "My fears, however, were\ngroundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his\npetition in a moving manner.",
        "As he saw that the very excess of his\nemotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old\nrelations, he became still more demonstrative.",
        "I glanced at Van Helsing,\nand saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more\nfixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his\nefforts were unavailing.",
        "I had previously seen something of the same\nconstantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request\nof which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when\nhe wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same\nsullen acquiescence on this occasion.",
        "My expectation was not realised,\nfor, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into\nquite a frantic condition.",
        "He threw himself on his knees, and held up\nhis hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth\na torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks and his\nwhole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--\n\n\u201cLet me entreat you, Dr.",
        "Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me\nout of this house at once.",
        "Send me away how you will and where you\nwill; send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in\na strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let\nme go out of this.",
        "You don\u2019t know what you do by keeping me here.",
        "I am\nspeaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul.",
        "You don\u2019t know\nwhom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell.",
        "Woe is me!",
        "I may not tell.",
        "By all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is\nlost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me\nout of this and save my soul from guilt!",
        "Can\u2019t you hear me, man?",
        "Can\u2019t\nyou understand?",
        "Will you never learn?",
        "Don\u2019t you know that I am sane and\nearnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting\nfor his soul?",
        "Oh, hear me!",
        "hear me!",
        "Let me go!",
        "let me go!",
        "let me go!\u201d\n\nI thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so\nwould bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.",
        "\u201cCome,\u201d I said sternly, \u201cno more of this; we have had quite enough\nalready.",
        "Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly.\u201d\n\nHe suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments.",
        "Then without a word he rose, and moving over, sat down on the side of\nthe bed.",
        "The collapse had come, as on former occasions, just as I had\nexpected.",
        "When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a\nquiet, well-bred voice:--\n\n\u201cYou will, I trust, Dr.",
        "Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later\non, that I did what I could to convince you tonight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.",
        "/Jonathan Harker\u2019s Journal./\n\n\n_1 October, 5 a.m._--I went with the party to the search with an easy\nmind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well.",
        "I am\nso glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.",
        "Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at\nall; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and\nbrains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way\nthat every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and\nthat she can henceforth leave the rest to us.",
        "We were, I think, all a\nlittle upset by the scene with Mr.",
        "Renfield.",
        "When we came away from his\nroom we were silent till we got back to the study.",
        "Then Mr.",
        "Morris said\nto Dr.",
        "Seward:--\n\n\u201cSay, Jack, if that man wasn\u2019t attempting a bluff, he is about the\nsanest lunatic I ever saw.",
        "I\u2019m not sure, but I believe that he had some\nserious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a\nchance.\u201d Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr.",
        "Van Helsing added:--\n\n\u201cFriend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I\u2019m glad of it,\nfor I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last\nhysterical outburst have given him free.",
        "But we live and learn, and in\nour present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.",
        "All is best as they are.\u201d Dr.",
        "Seward seemed to answer them both in a\ndreamy kind of way:--\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know but that I agree with you.",
        "If that man had been an\nordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he\nseems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am\nafraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads.",
        "I can\u2019t forget how\nhe prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear\nmy throat out with his teeth.",
        "Besides, he called the Count \u2018lord and\nmaster,\u2019 and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.",
        "That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help\nhim, so I suppose he isn\u2019t above trying to use a respectable lunatic.",
        "He certainly did seem earnest, though.",
        "I only hope we have done what is\nbest.",
        "These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,\nhelp to unnerve a man.\u201d The Professor stepped over, and laying a hand on\nhis shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--\n\n\u201cFriend John, have no fear.",
        "We are trying to do our duty in a very sad\nand terrible case; we can only do as we deem best.",
        "What else have we to\nhope for, except the pity of the good God?\u201d Lord Godalming had slipped\naway for a few minutes, but he now returned.",
        "He held up a little silver\nwhistle as he remarked:--\n\n\u201cThat old place may be full of rats, and if so, I\u2019ve got an antidote on\ncall.\u201d Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care\nto keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone\nout.",
        "When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took\nout a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four\nlittle groups, evidently one for each.",
        "Then he spoke:--\n\n\u201cMy friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of\nmany kinds.",
        "Our enemy is not merely spiritual.",
        "Remember that he has the\nstrength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are\nof the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his is not\namenable to mere strength.",
        "A stronger man, or a body of men more strong\nin all than him, can at certain times hold him; but yet they cannot hurt\nhim as we can be hurt by him.",
        "We must, therefore, guard ourselves from\nhis touch.",
        "Keep this near your heart\u201d--as he spoke he lifted a little\nsilver crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--\u201cput\nthese flowers round your neck\u201d--here he handed to me a wreath of\nwithered garlic blossoms--\u201cfor other enemies more mundane, this revolver\nand this knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which\nyou can fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last,\nthis, which we must not desecrate needless.\u201d This was a portion of\nsacred wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me.",
        "Each of the\nothers was similarly equipped.",
        "\u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cfriend John, where are\nthe skeleton keys?",
        "If so that we can open the door, we need not break\nhouse by the window, as before at Miss Lucy\u2019s.\u201d\n\nDr.",
        "Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as\na surgeon standing him in good stead.",
        "Presently he got one to suit;\nafter a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty\nclang, shot back.",
        "We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and\nit slowly opened.",
        "It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in\nDr.",
        "Seward\u2019s diary of the opening of Miss Westenra\u2019s tomb; I fancy that\nthe same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they\nshrank back.",
        "The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped\ninto the open door.",
        "\u201c_In manus tuas, Domine!_\u201d he said, crossing himself as he passed over\nthe threshold.",
        "We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have\nlit our lamps we might possibly attract attention from the road.",
        "The\nProfessor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it\nfrom within should we be in a hurry to make our exit.",
        "Then we all lit\nour lamps and proceeded on our search.",
        "The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the\nrays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great\nshadows.",
        "I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there\nwas some one else amongst us.",
        "I suppose it was the recollection, so\npowerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible\nexperience in Transylvania.",
        "I think the feeling was common to us all,\nfor I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every\nsound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.",
        "The whole place was thick with dust.",
        "The floor was seemingly inches\ndeep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down\nmy lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was caked.",
        "The\nwalls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of\nspiders\u2019 webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old\ntattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down.",
        "On a table in the\nhall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each.",
        "They\nhad been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents\nin the blanket of dust, like that exposed when the Professor lifted the\nkeys.",
        "He turned to me and said:----\n\n\u201cYou know this place, Jonathan.",
        "You have copied maps of it, and you\nknow at least more than we do.",
        "Which is the way to the chapel?\u201d I had\nan idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been\nable to get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong\nturnings found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with\niron bands.",
        "\u201cThis is the spot,\u201d said the Professor, as he turned his\nlamp on a small map of the house, copied from the file of my original\ncorrespondence regarding the purchase.",
        "With a little trouble we found\nthe key on the bunch and opened the door.",
        "We were prepared for some\nunpleasantness, for as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air\nseemed to exhale through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an\nodour as we encountered.",
        "None of the others had met the Count at all at\nclose quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting\nstage of his existence in his rooms or, when he was bloated with fresh\nblood, in a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was\nsmall and close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul.",
        "There was an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the\nfouler air.",
        "But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it?",
        "It was\nnot alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with\nthe pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption\nhad become itself corrupt.",
        "Faugh!",
        "it sickens me to think of it.",
        "Every\nbreath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and\nintensified its loathsomeness.",
        "Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our\nenterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and\nterrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose\nabove merely physical considerations.",
        "After the involuntary shrinking\nconsequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our\nwork as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.",
        "We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we\nbegan:----\n\n\u201cThe first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then\nexamine every hole and corner and cranny, and see if we cannot get some\nclue as to what has become of the rest.\u201d A glance was sufficient to show\nhow many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was\nno mistaking them.",
        "There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty!",
        "Once I got a fright,\nfor, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted\ndoor into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my\nheart stood still.",
        "Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to\nsee the high lights of the Count\u2019s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the\nred eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor.",
        "It was only for a moment, for\nas Lord Godalming said, \u201cI thought I saw a face, but it was only the\nshadows,\u201d and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,\nand stepped into the passage.",
        "There was no sign of any one; and as there\nwere no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid\nwalls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_.",
        "I\ntook it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.",
        "A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which\nhe was examining.",
        "We all followed his movements with our eyes, for\nundoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass\nof phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars.",
        "We all instinctively drew\nback.",
        "The whole place was becoming alive with rats.",
        "For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was\nseemingly prepared for such an emergency.",
        "Rushing over to the great\niron-bound oaken door, which Dr.",
        "Seward had described from the outside,\nand which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the\nhuge bolts, and swung the door open.",
        "Then, taking his little silver\nwhistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call.",
        "It was answered\nfrom behind Dr.",
        "Seward\u2019s house by the yelping of dogs, and after about\na minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.",
        "Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I\nnoticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been\ntaken out had been brought this way.",
        "But even in the minute that had\nelapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased.",

        "The dogs dashed on, but at the\nthreshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting\ntheir noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion.",
        "The rats were\nmultiplying in thousands, and moved out.",
        "Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him\non the floor.",
        "The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to\nrecover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies.",
        "They fled before\nhim so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other\ndogs, who had by now been lifted in in the same manner, had but small\nprey ere the whole mass had vanished.",
        "With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for\nthe dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at\ntheir prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in\nthe air with vicious shakes.",
        "We all seemed to find our spirits rise.",
        "Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening\nof the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding\nourselves in the open, I know not; but most certainly the shadow of\ndread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming\nlost something of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a\nwhit in our resolution.",
        "We closed the outer door and barred and locked\nit, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house.",
        "We\nfound nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and\nall untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.",
        "Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when\nwe returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been\nrabbit-hunting in a summer wood.",

        "No harm\nhas come to us such as I feared might be, and yet we have ascertained\nhow many boxes are missing.",
        "More than all do I rejoice that this, our\nfirst--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been\naccomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina\nor troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and\nsmells of horror which she might never forget.",
        "One lesson, too, we have\nlearned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute\nbeasts which are to the Count\u2019s command are yet themselves not amenable\nto his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his\ncall, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and\nto that poor mother\u2019s cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell\nfrom the so little dogs of my friend Arthur.",
        "We have other matters\nbefore us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used\nhis power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.",
        "So be it that he has gone elsewhere.",
        "Good!",
        "It has given us opportunity\nto cry \u2018check\u2019 in some way in this chess game, which we play for the\nstake of human souls.",
        "And now let us go home.",
        "The dawn is close at hand,\nand we have reason to be content with our first night\u2019s work.",
        "It may be\nordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;\nbut we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink.\u201d\n\nThe house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who\nwas screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound\nfrom Renfield\u2019s room.",
        "The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,\nafter the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.",
        "I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing\nso softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it.",
        "She looks paler\nthan usual.",
        "I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her.",
        "I am truly\nthankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our\ndeliberations.",
        "It is too great a strain for a woman to bear.",
        "I did not\nthink so at first, but I know better now.",
        "Therefore I am glad that it\nis settled.",
        "There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and\nyet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she\nsuspected that there was any concealment.",
        "Henceforth our work is to be\na sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that\nall is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world.",

        "I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.",
        "_1 October, later._--I suppose it was natural that we should have all\noverslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no\nrest at all.",
        "Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept\ntill the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or\nthree times before she awoke.",
        "Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for\na few seconds she did not recognise me, but looked at me with a sort of\nblank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream.",
        "She\ncomplained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in\nthe day.",
        "We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it\nbe that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to\ntrace them all.",

        "Not a thing\nseemed to be stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so\nthat a thin streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible\nslowness across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience\nand a vitality of its own.",

        "Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the\nattendants were dealing with him.",
        "I was so frightened that I crept into\nbed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.",
        "I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have\nfallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the\nmorning, when Jonathan woke me.",
        "I think that it took me an effort and\na little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was\nbending over me.",
        "My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of\nthe way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.",
        "I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back.",
        "I\nwas very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and\nmy hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at\nthe usual pace.",

        "Then it began to\ndawn upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold.",
        "I put back the\nclothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim around\nme.",
        "The gas-light which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,\ncame only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently\ngrown thicker and poured into the room.",
        "Then it occurred to me that I\nhad shut the window before I had come to bed.",
        "I would have got out to\nmake certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my\nlimbs and even my will.",
        "I lay still and endured; that was all.",

        "It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became\nconcentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the\ntop of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye.",
        "Things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now\nwhirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words \u201ca\npillar of cloud by day and of fire by night.\u201d Was it indeed some such\nspiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep?",
        "But the pillar was\ncomposed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the\nred eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I\nlooked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like\ntwo red eyes; such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering\nwhen, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St.",

        "He was now\nfixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern\nshore, and on the south.",
        "The north and west were surely never meant to\nbe left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and the\nvery heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west.",

        "We\u2019re on the track anyhow.",
        "I am tired to-night, and want\nsleep.",
        "Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look\nas though she had been crying.",
        "Poor dear, I\u2019ve no doubt it frets her to\nbe kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the\nothers.",
        "But it is best as it is.",
        "It is better to be disappointed and\nworried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken.",

        "By the first\npost I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on\nwhich was written with a carpenter\u2019s pencil in a sprawling hand:--\n\n\u201cSam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth.",
        "Arsk for\nthe depite.\u201d\n\nI got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina.",
        "She looked heavy\nand sleepy and pale, and far from well.",
        "I determined not to wake her,\nbut that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for\nher going back to Exeter.",
        "I think she would be happier in our own home,\nwith her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and\nin ignorance.",
        "I only saw Dr.",
        "Seward for a moment, and told him where\nI was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I\nshould have found out anything.",
        "I drove to Walworth and found, with some\ndifficulty, Potter\u2019s Court.",
        "Mr.",
        "Smollet\u2019s spelling misled me, as I asked\nfor Poter\u2019s Court instead of Potter\u2019s Court.",
        "However, when I had found\nthe court I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran\u2019s lodging-house.",
        "When I asked the man who came to the door for the \u201cdepite,\u201d he shook his\nhead, and said: \u201cI dunno \u2019im.",
        "There ain\u2019t no such person \u2019ere; I never\n\u2019eard of \u2019im in all my bloomin\u2019 days.",
        "Don\u2019t believe there ain\u2019t nobody\nof that kind livin\u2019 \u2019ere or anywheres.\u201d I took out Smollet\u2019s letter, and\nas I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name\nof the court might guide me.",
        "\u201cWhat are you?\u201d I asked.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m the depity,\u201d he answered.",
        "I saw at once that I was on the right\ntrack; phonetic spelling had again misled me.",
        "A half-crown tip put\nthe deputy\u2019s knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr.",
        "Bloxam,\nwho had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at\nCorcoran\u2019s, had left for his work at Poplar at five o\u2019clock that\nmorning.",
        "He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but\nhe had a vague idea that it was some kind of a \u201cnew-fangled ware\u2019us;\u201d\nand with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar.",
        "It was twelve\no\u2019clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this\nI got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner.",
        "One of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel\nStreet a new \u201ccold storage\u201d building; and as this suited the condition\nof a \u201cnew-fangled ware\u2019us,\u201d I at once drove to it.",
        "An interview with a\nsurly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with\ncoin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my\nsuggesting that I was willing to pay his day\u2019s wages to his foreman for\nthe privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter.",
        "He was\na smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing.",
        "When I had\npromised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me\nthat he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,\nand had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--\u201cmain\nheavy ones\u201d--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose.",
        "I\nasked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to\nwhich he replied:--\n\n\u201cWell, guv\u2019nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from\na big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built.",
        "It was a\ndusty old \u2019ouse, too, though nothin\u2019 to the dustiness of the \u2019ouse we\ntooked the bloomin\u2019 boxes from.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you get into the house if they were both empty?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was the old party what engaged me a-waitin\u2019 in the \u2019ouse at\nPurfleet.",
        "He \u2019elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray.",
        "Curse\nme, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an\u2019 him a old feller,\nwith a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn\u2019t throw\na shadder.\u201d\n\nHow this phrase thrilled through me!",
        "\u201cWhy, \u2019e took up \u2019is end o\u2019 the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and\nme a-puffin\u2019 an\u2019 a-blowin\u2019 afore I could up-end mine anyhow--an\u2019 I\u2019m no\nchicken, neither.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you get into the house in Piccadilly?\u201d I asked.",
        "\u201cHe was there too.",
        "He must \u2019a\u2019 started off and got there afore me, for\nwhen I rung of the bell he kem an\u2019 opened the door \u2019isself an\u2019 \u2019elped me\nto carry the boxes into the \u2019all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole nine?\u201d I asked.",
        "\u201cYus; there was five in the first load an\u2019 four in the second.",
        "It\nwas main dry work, an\u2019 I don\u2019t so well remember \u2019ow I got \u2019ome.\u201d I\ninterrupted him:--\n\n\u201cWere the boxes left in the hall?\u201d\n\n\u201cYus; it was a big \u2019all, an\u2019 there was nothin\u2019 else in it.\u201d I made one\nmore attempt to further matters:--\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have any key?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever used no key nor nothink.",
        "The old gent, he opened the door \u2019isself\nan\u2019 shut it again when I druv off.",
        "I don\u2019t remember the last time--but\nthat was the beer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t remember the number of the house?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir.",
        "But ye needn\u2019t have no difficulty about that.",
        "It\u2019s a \u2019igh \u2019un\nwith a stone front with a bow on it, and \u2019igh steps up to the door.",
        "I\nknow them steps, \u2019avin\u2019 \u2019ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers\nwhat come round to earn a copper.",
        "The old gent give them shillin\u2019s, an\u2019\nthey seem\u2019 they got so much, they wanted more; but \u2019e took one of them\nby the shoulder and was like to throw \u2019im down the steps, till the lot\nof them went away cussin\u2019.\u201d I thought that with this description I could\nfind the house, so having paid my friend for his information, I started\noff for Piccadilly.",
        "I had gained a new painful experience: the Count\ncould, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself.",
        "If so, time was\nprecious; for, now he had achieved a certain amount of distribution,\nhe could, by choosing his own time, complete the task unobserved.",
        "At\nPiccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked westward; beyond\nthe Junior Constitutional I came across the house described, and was\nsatisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by Dracula.",
        "The\nhouse looked as though it had been long untenanted.",
        "The windows were\nencrusted with dust, and the shutters were up.",
        "All the framework was\nblack with time, and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away.",
        "It was evident that up to lately there had been a large notice-board\nin front of the balcony; it had, however, been roughly torn away, the\nuprights which had supported it still remaining.",
        "Behind the rails of\nthe balcony I saw there were some loose boards, whose raw edges looked\nwhite.",
        "I would have given a good deal to have been able to see the\nnotice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have given some clue to the\nownership of the house.",
        "I remembered my experience of the investigation\nand purchase of Carfax, and I could not but feel that if I could find\nthe former owner there might be some means of gaining access to the\nhouse.",
        "There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side,\nand nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if\nanything could be gathered from this quarter.",
        "The mews were active,\nthe Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation.",
        "I asked one or two\nof the grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me\nanything about the empty house.",
        "One of them said he had heard it had\nlately been taken, but he couldn\u2019t say from whom.",
        "He told me, however,\nthat up to very lately there had been a notice-board of \u201cFor sale\u201d up,\nand that perhaps Mitchell, Sons & Candy, the house agents, could tell\nme something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm\non the board.",
        "I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant\nknow or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled\naway.",
        "It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so\nI did not lose any time.",
        "Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons &\nCandy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in\nSackville Street.",
        "The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but\nuncommunicative in equal proportion.",
        "Having once told me that\nthe Piccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a\n\u201cmansion\u201d--was sold, he considered my business as concluded.",
        "When I\nasked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and\npaused a few seconds before replying:--\n\n\u201cIt is sold, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cPardon me,\u201d I said, with equal politeness, \u201cbut I have a special reason\nfor wishing to know who purchased it.\u201d\n\nAgain he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more.",
        "\u201cIt is sold,\nsir,\u201d was again his laconic reply.",
        "\u201cSurely,\u201d I said, \u201cyou do not mind letting me know so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I do mind,\u201d he answered.",
        "\u201cThe affairs of their clients are\nabsolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons & Candy.\u201d This was\nmanifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with\nhim.",
        "I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--\n\n\u201cYour clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their\nconfidence.",
        "I am myself a professional man.\u201d Here I handed him my card.",
        "\u201cIn this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of\nLord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,\nhe understood, lately for sale.\u201d These words put a different complexion\non affairs.",
        "He said:--\n\n\u201cI would like to oblige you if I could, Mr.",
        "Harker, and especially\nwould I like to oblige his lordship.",
        "We once carried out a small matter\nof renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur\nHolmwood.",
        "If you will let me have his lordship\u2019s address I will consult\nthe House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his\nlordship by to-night\u2019s post.",
        "It will be a pleasure if we can so far\ndeviate from our rules as to give the required information to his\nlordship.\u201d\n\nI wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,\ngave the address at Dr.",
        "Seward\u2019s, and came away.",
        "It was now dark, and I\nwas tired and hungry.",
        "I got a cup of tea at the A\u00ebrated Bread Company\nand came down to Purfleet by the next train.",
        "I found all the others at home.",
        "Mina was looking tired and pale, but\nshe made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful; it wrung my heart\nto think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her\ninquietude.",
        "Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking\non at our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our\nconfidence.",
        "It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of\nkeeping her out of our grim task.",
        "She seems somehow more reconciled; or\nelse the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when\nany accidental allusion is made she actually shudders.",
        "I am glad we made\nour resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing\nknowledge would be torture to her.",
        "I could not tell the others of the day\u2019s discovery till we were alone;\nso after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even\namongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.",
        "The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to\nme as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of\nand I came away.",
        "Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no\ndifference between us.",
        "When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in\nthe study.",
        "In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read\nit off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own\ninformation; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--\n\n\u201cThis has been a great day\u2019s work, friend Jonathan.",
        "Doubtless we are on\nthe track of the missing boxes.",
        "If we find them all in that house, then\nour work is near the end.",
        "But if there be some missing, we must search\nuntil we find them.",
        "Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the\nwretch to his real death.\u201d We all sat silent awhile, and all at once Mr.",
        "Morris spoke:--\n\n\u201cSay!",
        "how are we going to get into that house?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got into the other,\u201d answered Lord Godalming quickly.",
        "\u201cBut, Art, this is different.",
        "We broke house at Carfax, but we had night\nand a walled park to protect us.",
        "It will be a mighty different thing\nto commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night.",
        "I confess I\ndon\u2019t see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find\nus a key of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in\nthe morning.\u201d Lord Godalming\u2019s brows contracted, and he stood up and\nwalked about the room.",
        "By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one\nto another of us:--\n\n\u201cQuincey\u2019s head is level.",
        "This burglary business is getting serious; we\ngot off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless we\ncan find the Count\u2019s key basket.\u201d\n\nAs nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at\nleast advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell\u2019s,\nwe decided not to take any active step before breakfast time.",
        "For a good\nwhile we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and\nbearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the\nmoment.",
        "I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....\n\nJust a line.",
        "Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular.",
        "Her\nforehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even\nin her sleep.",
        "She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she\ndid this morning.",
        "To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be\nherself at home in Exeter.",
        "Oh, but I am sleepy!",

        "His moods change so\nrapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they\nalways mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more\nthan interesting study.",
        "This morning, when I went to see him after\nhis repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding\ndestiny.",
        "He was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively.",
        "He did not\nreally care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds\nand looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals.",
        "I\nthought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked\nhim:--\n\n\u201cWhat about the flies these times?\u201d He smiled on me in quite a superior\nsort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as\nhe answered me:--\n\n\u201cThe fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature: its wings are typical\nof the a\u00ebrial powers of the psychic faculties.",
        "The ancients did well\nwhen they typified the soul as a butterfly!\u201d\n\nI thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said\nquickly:--\n\n\u201cOh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?\u201d His madness foiled his\nreason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head\nwith a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--\n\n\u201cOh no, oh no!",
        "I want no souls.",
        "Life is all I want.\u201d Here he brightened\nup: \u201cI am pretty indifferent about it at present.",
        "Life is all right;\nI have all I want.",
        "You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to\nstudy zoophagy!\u201d\n\nThis puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--\n\n\u201cThen you command life; you are a god, I suppose?\u201d He smiled with an\nineffably benign superiority.",

        "If\nI may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things\npurely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied\nspiritually!\u201d This was a poser to me.",
        "I could not at the moment recall\nEnoch\u2019s appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt\nthat by doing so I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--\n\n\u201cAnd why Enoch?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he walked with God.\u201d I could not see the analogy, but did not\nlike to admit it; so I harked back to what he had denied:--\n\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t care about life and you don\u2019t want souls.",
        "Why not?\u201d I put\nmy question quickly and somewhat sternly, on purpose to disconcert him.",
        "The effort succeeded; for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his\nold servile manner, bent low before me, and actually fawned upon me as\nhe replied:--\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any souls, indeed, indeed!",
        "I don\u2019t.",
        "I couldn\u2019t use them\nif I had them; they would be no manner of use to me.",
        "I couldn\u2019t eat\nthem or----\u201d He suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over\nhis face, like a wind-sweep on the surface of the water.",

        "After a short time I saw that for the present it\nwas useless to speak to him.",
        "He was sulky, and so I came away.",

        "He does not wish\nto be disturbed in the work, without cause.",
        "I would have taken him with\nme to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he\nmight not care to go again.",
        "There was also another reason: Renfield\nmight not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were\nalone.",
        "I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose\nwhich is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part.",
        "When I\ncame in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his\nlips:--\n\n\u201cWhat about souls?\u201d It was evident then that my surmise had been\ncorrect.",
        "Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with\nthe lunatic.",
        "I determined to have the matter out.",

        "\u201cI don\u2019t want any souls!\u201d he said in a feeble, apologetic way.",
        "The\nmatter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to \u201cbe\ncruel only to be kind.\u201d So I said:--\n\n\u201cYou like life, and you want life?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes!",

        "You\u2019ve got their lives, you\nknow, and you must put up with their souls!\u201d Something seemed to affect\nhis imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes,\nscrewing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being\nsoaped.",
        "There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave\nme a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child,\nthough the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white.",
        "It\nwas evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance,\nand, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign\nto himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and\ngo with him.",

        "With a laugh he replied:--\n\n\u201cNot much!",
        "flies are poor things, after all!\u201d After a pause he added,\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want their souls buzzing round me, all the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr spiders,\u201d I went on.",

        "\u201cWhy do you plague me about\nsouls?",
        "Haven\u2019t I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already,\nwithout thinking of souls?\u201d He looked so hostile that I thought he\nwas in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle.",
        "The instant,\nhowever, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:--\n\n\u201cForgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself.",

        "I am\nsure you will understand!\u201d He had evidently self-control; so when the\nattendants came I told them not to mind, and they withdrew.",
        "Renfield\nwatched them go; when the door was closed he said, with considerable\ndignity and sweetness:--\n\n\u201cDr.",
        "Seward, you have been very considerate towards me.",
        "Believe me\nthat I am very very grateful to you!\u201d I thought it well to leave him in\nthis mood, and so I came away.",

        "As the face was exposed I could\nsee that it was horribly bruised, as though it had been beaten against\nthe floor--indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood\noriginated.",
        "The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as\nwe turned him over:--\n\n\u201cI think, sir, his back is broken.",
        "See, both his right arm and leg\nand the whole side of his face are paralysed.\u201d How such a thing could\nhave happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure.",
        "He seemed quite\nbewildered, and his brows were gathered in as he said:--\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t understand the two things.",

        "I saw a young woman do it once\nat the Eversfield Asylum before anyone could lay hands on her.",
        "And I\nsuppose he might have broke his back by falling out of bed, if he got\nin an awkward kink.",
        "But for the life of me I can\u2019t imagine how the two\nthings occurred.",
        "If his back was broke, he couldn\u2019t beat his head; and\nif his face was like that before the fall out of bed, there would be\nmarks of it.\u201d I said to him:--\n\n\u201cGo to Dr.",
        "Van Helsing, and ask him to kindly come here at once.",
        "I want\nhim without an instant\u2019s delay.\u201d The man ran off, and within a very few\nminutes the Professor, in his dressing-gown and slippers appeared.",
        "When\nhe saw Renfield on the ground, he looked keenly at him a moment and then\nturned to me.",
        "I think he recognized my thought in my eyes, for he said\nvery quietly, manifestly for the ears of the attendant:--\n\n\u201cAh, a sad accident!",
        "He will need very careful watching, and much\nattention.",
        "I shall stay with you myself; but I shall first dress myself.",
        "If you will remain I shall in a few minutes join you.\u201d\n\nThe patient was now breathing stertorously, and it was easy to see\nthat he had suffered some terrible injury.",
        "Van Helsing returned with\nextraordinary celerity, bearing with him a surgical case.",
        "He had\nevidently been thinking and had his mind made up; for, almost before he\nlooked at the patient, he whispered to me:--\n\n\u201cSend the attendant away.",
        "We must be alone with him when he becomes\nconscious, after the operation.\u201d So I said:--\n\n\u201cI think that will do now, Simmons.",

        "You had better go your round, and Dr.",
        "Van Helsing will operate.",
        "Let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe man withdrew, and we went into a strict examination of the patient.",
        "The wounds of the face were superficial; the real injury was a depressed\nfracture of the skull, extending right up through the motor area.",
        "The\nProfessor thought a moment and said:--\n\n\u201cWe must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions, as far\nas can be; the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of\nhis injury.",
        "The whole motor area seems affected.",
        "The suffusion of the\nbrain will increase quickly, so we must trephine at once or it may be\ntoo late.\u201d As he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door.",
        "I\nwent over and opened it and found in the corridor without, Arthur and\nQuincey in pyjamas and slippers: the former spoke:--\n\n\u201cI heard your man call up Dr.",
        "Van Helsing and tell him of an accident.",
        "So I woke Quincey, or rather called for him as he was not asleep.",
        "Things\nare moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of\nus these times.",
        "I\u2019ve been thinking that to-morrow night will not see\nthings as they have been.",
        "We\u2019ll have to look back--and forward a little\nmore than we have done.",
        "May we come in?\u201d I nodded, and held the door\nopen till they had entered; then I closed it again.",
        "When Quincey saw the\nattitude and state of the patient, and noted the horrible pool on the\nfloor, he said softly:--\n\n\u201cMy God!",
        "what has happened to him?",
        "Poor, poor devil!\u201d I told him\nbriefly, and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after\nthe operation--for a short time at all events.",
        "He went at once and sat\ndown on the edge of the bed, with Godalming beside him; we all watched\nin patience.",
        "\u201cWe shall wait,\u201d said Van Helsing, \u201cjust long enough to fix the best\nspot for trephining, so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove\nthe blood clot; for it is evident that the h\u00e6morrhage is increasing.\u201d\n\nThe minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness.",
        "I had\na horrible sinking in my heart, and from Van Helsing\u2019s face I gathered\nthat he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come.",
        "I\ndreaded the words that Renfield might speak.",
        "I was positively afraid to\nthink; but the conviction of what was coming was on me, as I have read\nof men who have heard the death-watch.",
        "The poor man\u2019s breathing came\nin uncertain gasps.",
        "Each instant he seemed as though he would open his\neyes and speak; but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath,\nand he would relapse into a more fixed insensibility.",
        "Inured as I was\nto sick-beds and death, this suspense grew, and grew upon me.",
        "I could\nalmost hear the beating of my own heart; and the blood surging through\nmy temples sounded like blows from a hammer.",
        "The silence finally became\nagonising.",
        "I looked at my companions, one after another, and saw from\ntheir flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal\ntorture.",
        "There was a nervous suspense over us all, as though overhead\nsome dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect\nit.",
        "At last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was\nsinking fast; he might die at any moment.",
        "I looked up at the Professor\nand caught his eyes fixed on mine.",
        "His face was sternly set as he\nspoke:--\n\n\u201cThere is no time to lose.",
        "His words may be worth many lives; I have\nbeen thinking so, as I stood here.",
        "It may be there is a soul at stake!",
        "We shall operate just above the ear.\u201d\n\nWithout another word he made the operation.",
        "For a few moments the\nbreathing continued to be stertorous.",
        "Then there came a breath so\nprolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest.",
        "Suddenly his eyes opened, and became fixed in a wild, helpless\nstare.",
        "This was continued for a few moments; then it softened into\na glad surprise, and from the lips came a sigh of relief.",
        "He moved\nconvulsively, and as he did so, said:--\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be quiet, Doctor.",
        "Tell them to take off the strait-waistcoat.",
        "I\nhave had a terrible dream, and it has left me so weak that I cannot\nmove.",
        "What\u2019s wrong with my face?",
        "It feels all swollen, and it smarts\ndreadfully.\u201d He tried to turn his head; but even with the effort his\neyes seemed to grow glassy again, so I gently put it back.",
        "Then Van\nHelsing said in a quiet, grave tone:--\n\n\u201cTell us your dream, Mr.",
        "Renfield.\u201d As he heard the voice his face\nbrightened through its mutilation, and he said:--\n\n\u201cThat is Dr.",
        "Van Helsing.",
        "How good it is of you to be here.",
        "Give me some\nwater, my lips are dry; and I shall try to tell you.",
        "I dreamed\u201d--he\nstopped and seemed fainting.",
        "I called quietly to Quincey--\u201cThe\nbrandy--it is in my study--quick!\u201d He flew and returned with a glass,\nthe decanter of brandy and a carafe of water.",
        "We moistened the parched\nlips, and the patient quickly revived.",
        "It seemed, however, that his poor\ninjured brain had been working in the interval, for, when he was quite\nconscious, he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which I\nshall never forget, and said:--\n\n\u201cI must not deceive myself; it was no dream, but all a grim reality.\u201d\nThen his eyes roved round the room; as they caught sight of the two\nfigures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on:--\n\n\u201cIf I were not sure already, I should know from them.\u201d For an instant\nhis eyes closed--not with pain or sleep but voluntarily, as though he\nwere bringing all his faculties to bear; when he opened them he said,\nhurriedly, and with more energy than he had yet displayed:--\n\n\u201cQuick, Doctor, quick.",
        "I am dying!",
        "I feel that I have but a few minutes;\nand then I must go back to death--or worse!",
        "Wet my lips with brandy\nagain.",
        "I have something that I must say before I die; or before my\npoor crushed brain dies anyhow.",
        "Thank you!",
        "It was that night after you\nleft me, when I implored you to let me go away.",
        "I couldn\u2019t speak then,\nfor I felt my tongue was tied; but I was as sane then, except in that\nway, as I am now.",
        "I was in an agony of despair for a long time after\nyou left me; it seemed hours.",
        "Then there came a sudden peace to me.",
        "My\nbrain seemed to become cool again, and I realized where I was.",
        "I heard\nthe dogs bark behind our house, but not where He was!\u201d As he spoke\nVan Helsing\u2019s eyes never blinked, but his hand came out and met mine\nand gripped it hard.",
        "He did not, however, betray himself; he nodded\nslightly, and said: \u201cGo on,\u201d in a low voice.",
        "Renfield proceeded:--\n\n\u201cHe came up to the window in the mist, as I had seen him often before;\nbut he was solid then--not a ghost, and his eyes were fierce like a\nman\u2019s when angry.",
        "He was laughing with his red mouth; the sharp white\nteeth glinted in the moonlight when He turned to look back over the belt\nof trees, to where the dogs were barking.",
        "I wouldn\u2019t ask him to come in\nat first, though I knew he wanted to--just as he had wanted all along.",
        "Then he began promising me things--not in words but by doing them.\u201d He\nwas interrupted by a word from the Professor:--\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy making them happen; just as he used to send in the flies when the\nsun was shining.",
        "Great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their\nwings; and big moths, in the night, with skull and cross-bones on their\nbacks.\u201d Van Helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously:--\n\n\u201cThe _Acberontia atropos of the Sphinges_--what you call the\n\u2018Death\u2019s-head moth!\u2019\u201d The patient went on without stopping.",
        "\u201cThen he began to whisper: \u2018Rats, rats, rats!",
        "Hundreds, thousands,\nmillions of them, and every one a life; and dogs to eat them, and cats\ntoo.",
        "All lives!",
        "all red blood, with years of life in it; and not merely\nbuzzing flies!\u2019 I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could\ndo.",
        "Then the dogs howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house.",
        "He\nbeckoned me to the window.",
        "I got up and looked out, and He raised his\nhands, and seemed to call out without using any words.",
        "A dark mass\nspread over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire;\nand then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that\nthere were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His,\nonly smaller.",
        "He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought\nHe seemed to be saying: \u2018All these lives will I give you, ay, and many\nmore and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and\nworship me!\u2019 And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to\nclose over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself\nopening the sash and saying to Him: \u2018Come in, Lord and Master!\u2019 The rats\nwere all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it\nwas only open an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in\nthrough the tiniest crack, and has stood before me in all her size and\nsplendour.\u201d\n\nHis voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and\nhe continued; but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in\nthe interval, for his story was further advanced.",
        "I was about to call\nhim back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: \u201cLet him go on.",
        "Do not interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at\nall if once he lost the thread of his thought.\u201d He proceeded:--\n\n\u201cAll day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not\neven a blow-fly, and when the moon got up I was pretty angry with him.",
        "When he slid in through the window, though it was shut, and did not even\nknock, I got mad with him.",
        "He sneered at me, and his white face looked\nout of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he\nowned the whole place, and I was no one.",
        "He didn\u2019t even smell the same\nas he went by me.",
        "I couldn\u2019t hold him.",
        "I thought that, somehow, Mrs.",
        "Harker had come into the room.\u201d\n\nThe two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind\nhim so that he could not see them, but where they could hear better.",
        "They were both silent, but the Professor started and quivered; his\nface, however, grew grimmer and sterner still.",
        "Renfield went on without\nnoticing:--\n\n\u201cWhen Mrs.",
        "Harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn\u2019t the same;\nit was like tea after the teapot had been watered.\u201d Here we all moved,\nbut no one said a word; he went on:--\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that she was here till she spoke; and she didn\u2019t look the\nsame.",
        "I don\u2019t care for the pale people; I like them with lots of blood\nin them, and hers had all seemed to have run out.",
        "I didn\u2019t think of it\nat the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad\nto know that He had been taking the life out of her.\u201d I could feel that\nthe rest quivered, as I did; but we remained otherwise still.",
        "\u201cSo when\nHe came to-night I was ready for Him.",
        "I saw the mist stealing in, and I\ngrabbed it tight.",
        "I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and\nas I knew I was a madman--at times anyhow--I resolved to use my power.",
        "Ay, and He felt it too, for He had to come out of the mist to struggle\nwith me.",
        "I held tight; and I thought I was going to win, for I didn\u2019t\nmean Him to take any more of her life, till I saw His eyes.",
        "They burned\ninto me, and my strength became like water.",
        "He slipped through it, and\nwhen I tried to cling to Him, He raised me up and flung me down.",
        "There\nwas a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed\nto steal away under the door.\u201d His voice was becoming fainter and his\nbreath more stertorous.",
        "Van Helsing stood up instinctively.",
        "\u201cWe know the worst now,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cHe is here, and we know his purpose.",
        "It may not be too late.",
        "Let us be armed--the same as we were the other\nnight, but lose no time; there is not an instant to spare.\u201d There was no\nneed to put our fear, nay our conviction, into words--we shared them in\ncommon.",
        "We all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we\nhad when we entered the Count\u2019s house.",
        "The Professor had his ready and\nas we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said:--\n\n\u201cThey never leave me; and they shall not till this unhappy business is\nover.",
        "Be wise also, my friends.",
        "It is no common enemy that we deal with.",
        "Alas!",
        "alas!",
        "that the dear Madam Mina should suffer.\u201d He stopped; his\nvoice was breaking, and I do not know if rage or terror predominated in\nmy own heart.",
        "Outside the Harkers\u2019 door we paused.",
        "Art and Quincey held back, and the\nlatter said:--\n\n\u201cShould we disturb her?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must,\u201d said Van Helsing grimly.",
        "\u201cIf the door be locked, I shall\nbreak it in.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay it not frighten her terribly?",
        "It is unusual to break into a lady\u2019s\nroom!\u201d Van Helsing said solemnly:--\n\n\u201cYou are always right; but this is life and death.",
        "All chambers are\nalike to the doctor; and even were they not they are all as one to me\nto-night.",
        "Friend John, when I turn the handle, if the door does not\nopen, do you put your shoulder down and shove; and you too, my friends.",
        "Now!\u201d\n\nHe turned the handle as he spoke, but the door did not yield.",
        "We threw\nourselves against it; with a crash it burst open, and we almost fell\nheadlong into the room.",
        "The Professor did actually fall, and I saw\nacross him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees.",
        "What I saw\nappalled me.",
        "I felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck,\nand my heart seemed to stand still.",
        "The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the\nroom was light enough to see.",
        "On the bed beside the window lay Jonathan\nHarker, his face flushed, and breathing heavily as though in a stupor.",
        "Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad\nfigure of his wife.",
        "By her side stood a tall, thin man, clad in black.",
        "His face was turned from us, but the instant we saw it we all recognised\nthe Count--in every way, even to the scar on his forehead.",
        "With his left\nhand he held both Mrs.",
        "Harker\u2019s hands, keeping them away with her arms\nat full tension; his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck,\nforcing her face down on his bosom.",
        "Her white nightdress was smeared\nwith blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man\u2019s bare breast which\nwas shown by his torn-open dress.",
        "The attitude of the two had a terrible\nresemblance to a child forcing a kitten\u2019s nose into a saucer of milk\nto compel it to drink.",
        "As we burst into the room, the Count turned his\nface, and the hellish look that I had heard described seemed to leap\ninto it.",
        "His eyes flamed red with devilish passion; the great nostrils\nof the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge; and the\nwhite sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth,\nchamped together like those of a wild beast.",
        "With a wrench, which threw\nhis victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height, he turned\nand sprang at us.",
        "But by this time the Professor had gained his feet,\nand was holding towards him the envelope which contained the Sacred\nWafer.",
        "The Count suddenly stopped, just as poor Lucy had done outside\nthe tomb, and cowered back.",
        "Further and further back he cowered, as we,\nlifting our crucifixes, advanced.",
        "The moonlight suddenly failed, as a\ngreat black cloud sailed across the sky; and when the gaslight sprang up\nunder Quincey\u2019s match, we saw nothing but a faint vapour.",
        "This, as we\nlooked, trailed under the door, which with the recoil from its bursting\nopen had swung back to its old position.",
        "Van Helsing, Art and I moved\nforward to Mrs.",
        "Harker, who by this time had drawn her breath and with\nit had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it\nseems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day.",
        "For a\nfew seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray.",
        "Her face was\nghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared\nher lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of\nblood.",
        "Her eyes were mad with terror.",
        "Then she put before her face her\npoor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the\nCount\u2019s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail\nwhich made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an\nendless grief.",
        "Van Helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently\nover her body, whilst Art, after looking at her face for an instant\ndespairingly, ran out of the room.",
        "Van Helsing whispered to me:--\n\n\u201cJonathan is in a stupor such as we know the Vampire can produce.",
        "We can do nothing with poor Madam Mina for a few moments till she\nrecovers herself; I must wake him!\u201d He dipped the end of a towel in\ncold water and with it began to flick him on the face, his wife all\nthe while holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that\nwas heart-breaking to hear.",
        "I raised the blind, and looked out of the\nwindow.",
        "There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey\nMorris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yew\ntree.",
        "It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the instant\nI heard Harker\u2019s quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness,\nand turned to the bed.",
        "On his face, as there might well be, was a look\nof wild amazement.",
        "He seemed dazed for a few seconds, and then full\nconsciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once, and he started up.",
        "His wife was aroused by the quick movement, and turned to him with her\narms stretched out, as though to embrace him; instantly, however, she\ndrew them in again, and putting her elbows together, held her hands\nbefore her face, and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook.",
        "\u201cIn God\u2019s name what does this mean?\u201d Harker cried out.",
        "\u201cDr.",
        "Seward, Dr.",
        "Van Helsing, what is it?",
        "What has happened?",
        "What is wrong?",
        "Mina, dear,\nwhat is it?",
        "What does that blood mean?",
        "My God, my God!",
        "has it come to\nthis!\u201d and, raising himself to his knees, he beat his hands wildly\ntogether.",
        "\u201cGood God help us!",
        "help her!",
        "oh, help her!\u201d With a quick\nmovement he jumped from the bed, and began to pull on his clothes--all\nthe man in him awake at the need for instant exertion.",
        "\u201cWhat has\nhappened?",
        "Tell me all about it!\u201d he cried without pausing.",
        "\u201cDr.",
        "Van\nHelsing, you love Mina, I know.",
        "Oh, do something to save her.",
        "It cannot\nhave gone too far yet.",
        "Guard her while I look for _him_!\u201d His wife,\nthrough her terror and horror and distress, saw some sure danger to him;\ninstantly forgetting her own grief, she seized hold of him and cried\nout:--\n\n\u201cNo!",
        "no!",
        "Jonathan, you must not leave me.",
        "I have suffered enough\nto-night, God knows, without the dread of his harming you.",
        "You must\nstay with me.",
        "Stay with these friends who will watch over you!\u201d Her\nexpression became frantic as she spoke; and, he yielding to her, she\npulled him down sitting on the bedside, and clung to him fiercely.",
        "Van Helsing and I tried to calm them both.",
        "The Professor held up his\nlittle golden crucifix, and said with wonderful calmness:--\n\n\u201cDo not fear, my dear.",
        "We are here; and whilst this is close to you\nno foul thing can approach.",
        "You are safe for to-night; and we must be\ncalm and take counsel together.\u201d She shuddered and was silent, holding\ndown her head on her husband\u2019s breast.",
        "When she raised it, his white\nnight-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where\nthe thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops.",
        "The instant she\nsaw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking\nsobs:--\n\n\u201cUnclean, unclean!",
        "I must touch him or kiss him no more.",
        "Oh, that it\nshould be that it is I who am now his worst enemy, and whom he may have\nmost cause to fear.\u201d To this he spoke out resolutely:--\n\n\u201cNonsense, Mina.",
        "It is a shame to me to hear such a word.",
        "I would not\nhear it of you; and I shall not hear it from you.",
        "May God judge me by my\ndeserts, and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour,\nif by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us!\u201d He put out\nhis arms and folded her to his breast; and for a while she lay there\nsobbing.",
        "He looked at us over her bowed head, with eyes that blinked\ndamply above his quivering nostrils; his mouth was set as steel.",
        "After\na while her sobs became less frequent and more faint, and then he said\nto me, speaking with a studied calmness which I felt tried his nervous\npower to the utmost:--\n\n\u201cAnd now, Dr.",
        "Seward, tell me all about it.",
        "Too well I know the broad\nfact; tell me all that has been.\u201d I told him exactly what had happened,\nand he listened with seeming impassiveness; but his nostrils twitched\nand his eyes blazed as I told how the ruthless hands of the Count had\nheld his wife in that terrible and horrid position, with her mouth to\nthe open wound in his breast.",
        "It interested me, even at that moment, to\nsee that whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over\nthe bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled\nhair.",
        "Just as I had finished, Quincey and Godalming knocked at the\ndoor.",
        "They entered in obedience to our summons.",
        "Van Helsing looked at\nme questioningly.",
        "I understood him to mean if we were to take advantage\nof their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy\nhusband and wife from each other and from themselves; so on my nodding\nacquiescence to him he asked them what they had seen or done.",
        "To which\nLord Godalming answered:--\n\n\u201cI could not see him anywhere in the passage, or in any of our rooms.",
        "I\nlooked in the study, but, though he had been there, he had gone.",
        "He had,\nhowever----\u201d He stopped suddenly, looking at the poor drooping figure on\nthe bed.",
        "Van Helsing said gravely:--\n\n\u201cGo on friend Arthur.",
        "We want no more concealments.",
        "Our hope now is in\nknowing all.",
        "Tell freely!\u201d So Art went on:--\n\n\u201cHe had been there, and though it could only have been for a few\nseconds, he made rare hay of the place.",
        "All the manuscript had been\nburned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes;\nthe cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire, and the\nwax had helped the flames.\u201d Here I interrupted.",
        "\u201cThank God there is the\nother copy in the safe!\u201d His face lit for a moment, but fell again as he\nwent on: \u201cI ran downstairs then, but could see no sign of him.",
        "I looked\ninto Renfield\u2019s room; but there was no trace there except----!\u201d Again\nhe paused.",
        "\u201cGo on,\u201d said Harker hoarsely; so he bowed his head, and\nmoistening his lips with his tongue, added: \u201cexcept that the poor fellow\nis dead.\u201d Mrs.",
        "Harker raised her head, looking from one to the other of\nus as she said solemnly:--\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s will be done!\u201d I could not but feel that Art was keeping back\nsomething; but, as I took it that it was with a purpose, I said nothing.",
        "Van Helsing turned to Morris and asked:--\n\n\u201cAnd you, friend Quincey, have you any to tell?\u201d\n\n\u201cA little,\u201d he answered.",
        "\u201cIt may be much eventually, but at present I\ncan\u2019t say.",
        "I thought it well to know if possible where the Count would\ngo when he left the house.",
        "I did not see him; but I saw a bat rise from\nRenfield\u2019s window, and flap westward.",
        "I expected to see him in some\nshape go back to Carfax; but he evidently sought some other lair.",
        "He\nwill not be back to-night; for the sky is reddening in the east, and the\ndawn is close.",
        "We must work to-morrow!\u201d\n\nHe said the latter words through his shut teeth.",
        "For a space of perhaps\na couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could\nhear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his\nhand very tenderly on Mrs.",
        "Harker\u2019s head:--\n\n\u201cAnd now, Madam Mina--poor, dear, dear Madam Mina--tell us exactly what\nhappened.",
        "God knows that I do not want that you be pained; but it is\nneed that we know all.",
        "For now more than ever has all work to be done\nquick and sharp, and in deadly earnest.",
        "The day is close to us that must\nend all, if it may so be; and now is the chance that we may live and\nlearn.\u201d\n\nThe poor, dear lady shivered, and I could see the tension of her nerves\nas she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and\nlower still on his breast.",
        "Then she raised her head proudly, and held\nout one hand to Van Helsing, who took it in his, and, after stooping and\nkissing it reverently, held it fast.",
        "The other hand was locked in that\nof her husband, who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly.",
        "After a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she\nbegan:--\n\n\u201cI took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but\nfor a long time it did not act.",
        "I seemed to become more wakeful, and\nmyriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind--all of them\nconnected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.\u201d\nHer husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said\nlovingly: \u201cDo not fret, dear.",
        "You must be brave and strong, and help me\nthrough the horrible task.",
        "If you only knew what an effort it is to me\nto tell of this fearful thing at all, you would understand how much I\nneed your help.",
        "Well, I saw I must try to help the medicine do its work\nwith my will, if it was to do me any good, so I resolutely set myself to\nsleep.",
        "Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remembered no\nmore.",
        "Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when\nnext I remember.",
        "There was in the room the same thin white mist that\nI had before noticed.",
        "But I forget now if you know of this; you will\nfind it in my diary which I shall show you later.",
        "I felt the same vague\nterror which had come to me before, and the same sense of some presence.",
        "I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it\nseemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught and not I. I\ntried, but could not wake him.",
        "This caused me a great fear, and I looked\naround terrified.",
        "Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside the bed,\nas if he had stepped out of the mist--or rather as if the mist had\nturned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared--stood a tall,\nthin man, all in black.",
        "I knew him at once from the descriptions of the\nothers.",
        "The waxen face; the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell\nin a thin white line; the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth\nshowing between; and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset\non the windows of St.",
        "Mary\u2019s Church at Whitby.",
        "I knew, too, the red scar\non his forehead where Jonathan had struck him.",
        "For an instant my heart\nstood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was paralysed.",
        "In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper, pointing as he\nspoke to Jonathan:--\n\n\u201c\u2018Silence!",
        "If you make a sound I shall take him and dash his brains out\nbefore your very eyes.\u2019 I was appalled and was too bewildered to do or\nsay anything.",
        "With a mocking smile, he placed one hand upon my shoulder\nand, holding me tight, bared my throat with the other, saying as he did\nso: \u2018First, a little refreshment to reward my exertions.",
        "You may as well\nbe quiet; it is not the first time, or the second, that your veins have\nappeased my thirst!\u2019 I was bewildered, and, strangely enough, I did not\nwant to hinder him.",
        "I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that\nsuch is, when his touch is on his victim.",
        "And oh, my God, my God, pity\nme!",
        "He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!\u201d Her husband groaned\nagain.",
        "She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if\nhe were the injured one, and went on:--\n\n\u201cI felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon.",
        "How long\nthis horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time\nmust have passed before he took his foul, awful sneering mouth away.",
        "I\nsaw it drip with the fresh blood!\u201d The remembrance seemed for a while\nto overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her\nhusband\u2019s sustaining arm.",
        "With a great effort she recovered herself and\nwent on:--\n\n\u201cThen he spoke to me mockingly: \u2018And so you, like the others, would\nplay your brains against mine.",
        "You would help these men to hunt me\nand frustrate me in my designs!",
        "You know now, and they know in part\nalready, and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path.",
        "They should have kept their energies for use closer to home.",
        "Whilst\nthey played wits against me--against me who commanded nations, and\nintrigued for them, and fought for them, hundreds of years before they\nwere born--I was countermining them.",
        "And you, their best beloved one,\nare now to me flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my\nbountiful wine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and\nmy helper.",
        "You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall\nminister to your needs.",
        "But as yet you are to be punished for what you\nhave done.",
        "You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my\ncall.",
        "When my brain says \u201cCome!\u201d to you, you shall cross land or sea\nto do my bidding; and to that end this!\u2019 With that he pulled open his\nshirt, and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast.",
        "When\nthe blood began to spurt out, he took my hands in one of his, holding\nthem tight, and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to\nthe wound, so that I must either suffocate or swallow some of the--Oh,\nmy God!",
        "my God!",
        "what have I done?",
        "What have I done to deserve such a\nfate, I who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my\ndays?",
        "God pity me!",
        "Look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril;\nand in mercy pity those to whom she is dear!\u201d Then she began to rub her\nlips as though to cleanse them from pollution.",
        "As she was telling her terrible story, the eastern sky began to quicken,\nand everything became more and more clear.",
        "Harker was still and quiet;\nbut over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look\nwhich deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first\nred streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out\nagainst the whitening hair.",
        "We have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy\npair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action.",

        "It\nis now six o\u2019clock, and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and\ntake something to eat; for Dr.",
        "Van Helsing and Dr.",
        "Seward are agreed\nthat if we do not eat we cannot work our best.",
        "Our best will be, God\nknows, required to-day.",
        "I must keep writing at every chance, for I dare\nnot stop to think.",
        "All, big and little, must go down; perhaps at the end\nthe little things may teach us most.",
        "The teaching, big or little, could\nnot have landed Mina or me anywhere worse than we are to-day.",
        "However,\nwe must trust and hope.",
        "Poor Mina told me just now, with the tears\nrunning down her dear cheeks, that it is in trouble and trial that our\nfaith is tested--that we must keep on trusting; and that God will aid us\nup to the end.",
        "The end!",
        "oh, my God!",
        "what end?...",
        "To work!",
        "To work!",
        "When Dr.",
        "Van Helsing and Dr.",
        "Seward had come back from seeing poor\nRenfield, we went gravely into what was to be done.",
        "First, Dr.",
        "Seward\ntold us that when he and Dr.",
        "Van Helsing had gone down to the room below\nthey had found Renfield lying on the floor, all in a heap.",
        "His face was\nall bruised and crushed in, and the bones of the neck were broken.",
        "Dr.",
        "Seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had\nheard anything.",
        "He said that he had been sitting down--he confessed to\nhalf dozing--when he heard loud voices in the room, and then Renfield\nhad called out loudly several times, \u201cGod!",
        "God!",
        "God!\u201d After that there\nwas a sound of falling, and when he entered the room he found him lying\non the floor, face down, just as the doctors had seen him.",
        "Van Helsing\nasked if he had heard \u201cvoices\u201d or \u201ca voice,\u201d and he said he could not\nsay; that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two, but as\nthere was no one in the room it could have been only one.",
        "He could swear\nto it, if required, that the word \u201cGod\u201d was spoken by the patient.",
        "Dr.",
        "Seward said to us, when we were alone, that he did not wish to go into\nthe matter; the question of an inquest had to be considered, and it\nwould never do to put forward the truth, as no one would believe it.",
        "As it was, he thought that on the attendant\u2019s evidence he could give a\ncertificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed.",
        "In case the\ncoroner should demand it, there would be a formal inquest, necessarily\nto the same result.",
        "When the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next\nstep, the very first thing we decided was that Mina should be in full\nconfidence; that nothing of any sort--no matter how painful--should be\nkept from her.",
        "She herself agreed as to its wisdom, and it was pitiful\nto see her so brave and yet so sorrowful, and in such a depth of\ndespair.",
        "\u201cThere must be no more concealment,\u201d she said.",
        "\u201cAlas!",
        "we have\nhad too much already.",
        "And besides there is nothing in all the world that\ncan give me more pain than I have already endured--than I suffer now!",
        "Whatever may happen, it must be of new hope or of new courage to me!\u201d\nVan Helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke, and said, suddenly\nbut quietly:--\n\n\u201cBut, dear Madam Mina are you not afraid; not for yourself, but for\nothers from yourself, after what has happened?\u201d Her face grew set in\nits lines, but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she\nanswered:--\n\n\u201cAh no!",
        "for my mind is made up!\u201d\n\n\u201cTo what?\u201d he asked gently, whilst we were all very still; for each in\nour own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant.",
        "Her answer\ncame with direct simplicity, as though she were simply stating a fact:--\n\n\u201cBecause if I find in myself--and I shall watch keenly for it--a sign of\nharm to any that I love, I shall die!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would not kill yourself?\u201d he asked hoarsely.",
        "\u201cI would; if there were no friend who loved me, who would save me such\na pain, and so desperate an effort!\u201d She looked at him meaningly as she\nspoke.",
        "He was sitting down; but now he rose and came close to her and\nput his hand on her head as he said solemnly:--\n\n\u201cMy child, there is such an one if it were for your good.",
        "For myself\nI could hold it in my account with God to find such an euthanasia for\nyou, even at this moment, if it were best.",
        "Nay, were it safe!",
        "But, my\nchild----\u201d for a moment he seemed choked, and a great sob rose in his\nthroat; he gulped it down and went on:--\n\n\u201cThere are here some who would stand between you and death.",
        "You must\nnot die.",
        "You must not die by any hand; but least of all by your own.",
        "Until the other, who has fouled your sweet life, is true dead you must\nnot die; for if he is still with the quick Un-Dead, your death would\nmake you even as he is.",
        "No, you must live!",
        "You must struggle and strive\nto live, though death would seem a boon unspeakable.",
        "You must fight\nDeath himself, though he come to you in pain or in joy; by the day,\nor the night; in safety or in peril!",
        "On your living soul I charge you\nthat you do not die--nay, nor think of death--till this great evil be\npast.\u201d The poor dear grew white as death, and shook and shivered, as I\nhave seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide.",
        "We\nwere all silent; we could do nothing.",
        "At length she grew more calm, and\nturning to him said, sweetly, but oh!",
        "so sorrowfully, as she held out\nher hand:--\n\n\u201cI promise you, my dear friend, that if God will let me live, I shall\nstrive to do so; till, if it may be in His good time, this horror\nmay have passed away from me.\u201d She was so good and brave that we all\nfelt that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her,\nand we began to discuss what we were to do.",
        "I told her that she was\nto have all the papers in the safe, and all the papers or diaries and\nphonographs we might hereafter use; and was to keep the record as she\nhad done before.",
        "She was pleased with the prospect of anything to\ndo--if \u201cpleased\u201d could be used in connection with so grim an interest.",
        "As usual Van Helsing had thought ahead of everyone else, and was\nprepared with an exact ordering of our work.",
        "\u201cIt is perhaps well\u201d he said, \u201cthat at our meeting after our visit\nto Carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth-boxes that\nlay there.",
        "Had we done so, the Count must have guessed our purpose,\nand would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such\nan effort with regard to the others; but now he does not know our\nintentions.",
        "Nay more, in all probability he does not know that such a\npower exists to us as can sterilize his lairs, so that he cannot use\nthem as of old.",
        "We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge\nas to their disposition, that, when we have examined the house in\nPiccadilly, we may track the very last of them.",
        "To-day, then, is ours;\nand in it rests our hope.",
        "The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning\nguards us in its course.",
        "Until it sets to-night, that monster must\nretain whatever form he now has.",
        "He is confined within the limitations\nof his earthly envelope.",
        "He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear\nthrough cracks or chinks or crannies.",
        "If he go through a door-way, he\nmust open the door like a mortal.",
        "And so we have this day to hunt out\nall his lairs and sterilize them.",
        "So we shall, if we have not yet catch\nhim and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching\nand the destroying shall be, in time, sure.\u201d Here I started up for I\ncould not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so\npreciously laden with Mina\u2019s life and happiness were flying from us,\nsince whilst we talked action was possible.",
        "But Van Helsing held up his\nhand warningly.",
        "\u201cNay, friend Jonathan,\u201d he said, \u201cin this, the quickest\nway home is the longest way, so your proverb say.",
        "We shall all act, and\nact with desperate quick, when the time has come.",
        "But think, in all\nprobable the key of the situation is in that house in Piccadilly.",
        "The\nCount may have many houses which he has bought.",
        "Of them he will have\ndeeds of purchase, keys and other things.",
        "He will have paper that he\nwrite on; he will have his book of cheques.",
        "There are many belongings\nthat he must have somewhere; why not in this place so central, so quiet,\nwhere he come and go by the front or the back at all hour, when in the\nvery vast of the traffic there is none to notice.",
        "We shall go there and\nsearch that house; and when we learn what it holds, then we do what our\nfriend Arthur call, in his phrases of hunt, \u2018stop the earths\u2019 and so we\nrun down our old fox--so?",
        "is it not?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let us come at once,\u201d I cried, \u201cwe are wasting the precious,\nprecious time!\u201d The Professor did not move, but simply said:--\n\n\u201cAnd how are we to get into that house in Piccadilly?\u201d\n\n\u201cAny way!\u201d I cried.",
        "\u201cWe shall break in if need be.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your police; where will they be, and what will they say?\u201d\n\nI was staggered; but I knew that if he wished to delay he had a good\nreason for it.",
        "So I said, as quietly as I could:--\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait more than need be; you know, I am sure, what torture I am\nin.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, my child, that I do; and indeed there is no wish of me to add to\nyour anguish.",
        "But just think, what can we do, until all the world be at\nmovement?",
        "Then will come our time.",
        "I have thought and thought, and it\nseems to me that the simplest way is the best of all.",
        "Now we wish to get\ninto the house, but we have no key; is it not so?\u201d I nodded.",
        "\u201cNow suppose that you were, in truth, the owner of that house, and\ncould not still get it; and think there was to you no conscience of the\nhousebreaker, what would you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI should get a respectable locksmith, and set him to work to pick the\nlock for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your police, they would interfere, would they not?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no!",
        "not if they knew the man was properly employed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d he looked at me keenly as he spoke, \u201call that is in doubt is\nthe conscience of the employer, and the belief of your policemen as\nto whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one.",
        "Your police must indeed be zealous men and clever--oh, so clever!--in\nreading the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter.",
        "No, no,\nmy friend Jonathan, you go take the lock off a hundred empty houses\nin this your London, or of any city in the world; and if you do it as\nsuch things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly\ndone, no one will interfere.",
        "I have read of a gentleman who owned a so\nfine house in your London, and when he went for months of summer to\nZwitzerland and lock up his house, some burglar came and broke window at\nback and got in.",
        "Then he went and made open the shutters in front and\nwalk out and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police.",
        "Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big\nnotice; and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the\ngoods of that other man who own them.",
        "Then he go to a builder, and he\nsell him that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take\nall away within a certain time.",
        "And your police and other authority help\nhim all they can.",
        "And when that owner come back from his holiday in\nZwitzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been.",
        "This\nwas all done _en r\u00e8gle_; and in our work we shall be _en r\u00e8gle_ too.",
        "We\nshall not go so early that the policeman who have then little to think\nof, shall deem it strange; but we shall go after ten o\u2019clock when there\nare many about, and when such things would be done were we indeed owners\nof the house.\u201d\n\nI could not but see how right he was, and the terrible despair of Mina\u2019s\nface became relaxed a thought; there was hope in such good counsel.",
        "Van\nHelsing went on:--\n\n\u201cWhen once within that house we may find more clues; at any rate some of\nus can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be\nmore earth-boxes--at Bermondsey and Mile End.\u201d\n\nLord Godalming stood up.",
        "\u201cI can be of some use here,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cI shall\nwire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most\nconvenient.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook here, old fellow,\u201d said Morris, \u201cit is a capital idea to have all\nready in case we want to go horsebacking; but don\u2019t you think that one\nof your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byeway at\nWalworth or Mile End would attract too much attention for our purposes?",
        "It seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east; and\neven leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to.\u201d\n\n\u201cFriend Quincey is right!\u201d said the Professor.",
        "\u201cHis head is what you\ncall in plane with the horizon.",
        "It is a difficult thing that we go to\ndo, and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may.\u201d\n\nMina took a growing interest in everything, and I was rejoiced to see\nthat the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the\nterrible experience of the night.",
        "She was very, very pale--almost\nghastly, and so thin that her lips were drawn away, showing her teeth in\nsomewhat of prominence.",
        "I did not mention this last, lest it should give\nher needless pain; but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of\nwhat had occurred with poor Lucy when the Count had sucked her blood.",
        "As\nyet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper; but the time as yet\nwas short, and there was time for fear.",
        "When we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of\nthe disposition of our forces, there were new sources of doubt.",
        "It was\nfinally agreed that before starting for Piccadilly we should destroy the\nCount\u2019s lair close at hand.",
        "In case he should find it out too soon, we\nshould thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction; and his\npresence in his purely material shape, and at his weakest, might give us\nsome new clue.",
        "As to the disposal of forces, it was suggested by the Professor that,\nafter our visit to Carfax, we should all enter the house in Piccadilly;\nthat the two doctors and I should remain there, whilst Lord Godalming\nand Quincey found the lairs at Walworth and Mile End and destroyed\nthem.",
        "It was possible, if not likely, the Professor urged, that the\nCount might appear in Piccadilly during the day, and that if so we\nmight be able to cope with him then and there.",
        "At any rate we might be\nable to follow him in force.",
        "To this plan I strenuously objected, in\nso far as my going was concerned, for I said that I intended to stay\nand protect Mina.",
        "I thought that my mind was made up on the subject;\nbut Mina would not listen to my objection.",
        "She said that there might be\nsome law matter in which I could be useful; that amongst the Count\u2019s\npapers might be some clue which I could understand out of my experience\nin Transylvania; and that, as it was, all the strength we could muster\nwas required to cope with the Count\u2019s extraordinary power.",
        "I had to\ngive in, for Mina\u2019s resolution was fixed; she said that it was the last\nhope for _her_ that we should all work together.",
        "\u201cAs for me,\u201d she said,\n\u201cI have no fear.",
        "Things have been as bad as they can be; and whatever\nmay happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort.",
        "Go, my\nhusband!",
        "God can, if He wishes it, guard me as well alone as with any\none present.\u201d So I started up crying out: \u201cThen in God\u2019s name let us\ncome at once, for we are losing time.",
        "The Count may come to Piccadilly\nearlier than we think.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot so!\u201d said Van Helsing, holding up his hand.",
        "\u201cBut why?\u201d I asked.",
        "\u201cDo you forget,\u201d he said, with actually a smile, \u201cthat last night he\nbanqueted heavily, and will sleep late?\u201d\n\nDid I forget!",
        "shall I ever--can I ever!",
        "Can any of us ever forget that\nterrible scene!",
        "Mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance; but\nthe pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face, and\nshuddered whilst she moaned.",
        "Van Helsing had not intended to recall\nher frightful experience.",
        "He had simply lost sight of her and her part\nin the affair in his intellectual effort.",
        "When it struck him what he\nhad said, he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort\nher.",
        "\u201cOh Madam Mina,\u201d he said, \u201cdear, dear Madam Mina, alas!",
        "that I,\nof all who so reverence you, should have said anything so forgetful.",
        "These stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve\nso; but you will forget it, will you not?\u201d He bent low beside her as he\nspoke; she took his hand, and looking at him through her tears, said\nhoarsely:--\n\n\u201cNo, I shall not forget, for it is well that I remember; and with it\nI have so much in memory of you that is sweet, that I take it all\ntogether.",
        "Now, you must all be going soon.",
        "Breakfast is ready, and we\nmust all eat that we may be strong.\u201d\n\nBreakfast was a strange meal to us all.",
        "We tried to be cheerful and\nencourage each other, and Mina was the brightest and most cheerful of\nus.",
        "When it was over, Van Helsing stood up and said:--\n\n\u201cNow, my dear friends, we go forth to our terrible enterprise.",
        "Are we\nall armed, as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy\u2019s\nlair; armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack?\u201d We all assured\nhim.",
        "\u201cThen it is well.",
        "Now, Madam Mina, you are in any case _quite_ safe\nhere until the sunset; and before then we shall return--if--we shall\nreturn!",
        "But before we go let me see you armed against personal attack.",
        "I\nhave myself, since you came down, prepared your chamber by the placing\nof the things of which we know, so that He may not enter.",
        "Now let me\nguard yourself.",
        "On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in\nthe name of the Father, the Son, and----\u201d\n\nThere was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear.",
        "As he\nplaced the Wafer on Mina\u2019s forehead, it had seared it--had burned into\nthe flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal.",
        "My poor\ndarling\u2019s brain told her the significance of the fact as quickly as her\nnerves received the pain of it; and the two so overwhelmed her that her\noverwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream.",
        "But the words\nto her thought came quickly; the echo of the scream had not ceased to\nring on the air when there came the reaction, and she sank on her knees\non the floor in an agony of abasement.",
        "Pulling her beautiful hair over\nher face, as the leper of old his mantle, she wailed out:--\n\n\u201cUnclean!",
        "Unclean!",
        "Even the Almighty shuns my polluted flesh!",
        "I must\nbear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the Judgment Day.\u201d They\nall paused.",
        "I had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless\ngrief, and putting my arms around held her tight.",
        "For a few minutes our\nsorrowful hearts beat together, whilst the friends around us turned away\ntheir eyes that ran tears silently.",
        "Then Van Helsing turned and said\ngravely; so gravely that I could not help feeling that he was in some\nway inspired and was stating things outside himself:--\n\n\u201cIt may be that you may have to bear that mark till God Himself see fit,\nas He most surely shall, on the Judgment Day to redress all wrongs of\nthe earth and of His children that He has placed thereon.",
        "And oh, Madam\nMina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that\nred scar, the sign of God\u2019s knowledge of what has been, shall pass away\nand leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know.",
        "For so surely as\nwe live, that scar shall pass away when God see right to lift the burden\nthat is hard upon us.",
        "Till then we bear our Cross, as His Son did in\nobedience to His will.",
        "It may be that we are chosen instruments of His\ngood pleasure, and that we ascend to His bidding as that other through\nstripes and shame; through tears and blood; through doubts and fears,\nand all that makes the difference between God and man.\u201d\n\nThere was hope in his words, and comfort; and they made for resignation.",
        "Mina and I both felt so, and simultaneously we each took one of the old\nman\u2019s hands and bent over and kissed it.",
        "Then without a word we all\nknelt down together, and, all holding hands, swore to be true to each\nother.",
        "We men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the\nhead of her whom, each in his own way, we loved; and we prayed for help\nand guidance in the terrible task which lay before us.",
        "It was then time to start.",
        "So I said farewell to Mina, a parting which\nneither of us shall forget to our dying day; and we set out.",
        "To one thing I have made up my mind: if we find out that Mina must be\na vampire in the end, then she shall not go into that unknown and\nterrible land alone.",
        "I suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire\nmeant many; just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred\nearth, so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly\nranks.",
        "We entered Carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on\nthe first occasion.",
        "It was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic\nsurroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such\nfear as we already knew.",
        "Had not our minds been made up, and had there\nnot been terrible memories to spur us on, we could hardly have proceeded\nwith our task.",
        "We found no papers, nor any sign of use in the house; and\nin the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last.",
        "Dr.",
        "Van Helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them:--\n\n\u201cAnd now, my friends, we have a duty here to do.",
        "We must sterilise\nthis earth, so sacred of holy memories, that he has brought from a far\ndistant land for such fell use.",
        "He has chosen this earth because it has\nbeen holy.",
        "Thus we defeat him with his own weapon, for we make it more\nholy still.",
        "It was sanctified to such use of man, now we sanctify it to\nGod.\u201d As he spoke he took from his bag a screw-driver and a wrench, and\nvery soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open.",
        "The earth smelled\nmusty and close; but we did not somehow seem to mind, for our attention\nwas concentrated on the Professor.",
        "Taking from his box a piece of the\nSacred Wafer he laid it reverently on the earth, and then shutting down\nthe lid began to screw it home, we aiding him as he worked.",
        "One by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes, and left\nthem as we had found them to all appearance; but in each was a portion\nof the Host.",
        "When we closed the door behind us, the Professor said solemnly:--\n\n\u201cSo much is already done.",
        "If it may be that with all the others we can\nbe so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam\nMina\u2019s forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!\u201d\n\nAs we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our\ntrain we could see the front of the asylum.",
        "I looked eagerly, and in the\nwindow of my room saw Mina.",
        "I waved my hand to her, and nodded to tell\nthat our work there was successfully accomplished.",
        "She nodded in reply\nto show that she understood.",
        "The last I saw, she was waving her hand in\nfarewell.",
        "It was with a heavy heart that we sought the station and just\ncaught the train, which was steaming in as we reached the platform.",
        "I have written this in the train.",
        "_Piccadilly, 12.30 o\u2019clock._--Just before we reached Fenchurch Street\nLord Godalming said to me:\n\n\u201cQuincey and I will find a locksmith.",
        "You had better not come with us\nin case there should be any difficulty; for under the circumstances it\nwouldn\u2019t seem so bad for us to break into an empty house.",
        "But you are\na solicitor, and the Incorporated Law Society might tell you that you\nshould have known better.\u201d I demurred as to my not sharing any danger\neven of odium, but he went on: \u201cBesides, it will attract less attention\nif there are not too many of us.",
        "My title will make it all right with\nthe locksmith, and with any policeman that may come along.",
        "You had\nbetter go with Jack and the Professor and stay in the Green Park,\nsomewhere in sight of the house; and when you see the door open and the\nsmith has gone away, do you all come across.",
        "We shall be on the look out\nfor you, and will let you in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe advice is good!\u201d said Van Helsing, so we said no more.",
        "Godalming\nand Morris hurried off in a cab, we following in another.",
        "At the corner\nof Arlington Street our contingent got out and strolled into the Green\nPark.",
        "My heart beat as I saw the house on which so much of our hope was\ncentred, looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst\nits more lively and spruce-looking neighbours.",
        "We sat down on a bench\nwithin good view, and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little\nattention as possible.",
        "The minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we\nwaited for the coming of the others.",
        "At length we saw a four-wheeler drive up.",
        "Out of it, in leisurely\nfashion, got Lord Godalming and Morris; and down from the box descended\na thick-set working man with his rush-woven basket of tools.",
        "Morris\npaid the cabman, who touched his hat and drove away.",
        "Together the two\nascended the steps, and Lord Godalming pointed out what he wanted done.",
        "The workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes\nof the rail, saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered\nalong.",
        "The policeman nodded acquiescence, and the man kneeling down\nplaced his bag beside him.",
        "After searching through it, he took out a\nselection of tools which he proceeded to lay beside him in orderly\nfashion.",
        "Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and\nturning to his employers, made some remark.",
        "Lord Godalming smiled, and\nthe man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he\nbegan to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it.",
        "After fumbling\nabout for a bit he tried a second, and then a third.",
        "All at once the\ndoor opened under a slight push from him, and he and the two others\nentered the hall.",
        "We sat still; my own cigar burnt furiously, but Van\nHelsing\u2019s went cold altogether.",
        "We waited patiently as we saw the\nworkman come out and take in his bag.",
        "Then he held the door partly open,\nsteading it with his knees, whilst he fitted a key to the lock.",
        "This he\nfinally handed to Lord Godalming, who took out his purse and gave him\nsomething.",
        "The man touched his hat, took his bag, put on his coat and\ndeparted; not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction.",
        "When the man had fairly gone, we three crossed the street and knocked at\nthe door.",
        "It was immediately opened by Quincey Morris, beside whom stood\nLord Godalming lighting a cigar.",
        "\u201cThe place smells so vilely,\u201d said the latter as we came in.",
        "It did\nindeed smell vilely--like the old chapel at Carfax--and with our\nprevious experience it was plain to us that the Count had been using\nthe place pretty freely.",
        "We moved to explore the house, all keeping\ntogether in case of attack; for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy\nto deal with, and as yet we did not know whether the Count might not be\nin the house.",
        "In the dining-room, which lay at the back of the hall,\nwe found eight boxes of earth.",
        "Eight boxes only out of the nine which\nwe sought!",
        "Our work was not over, and would never be until we should\nhave found the missing box.",
        "First we opened the shutters of the window\nwhich looked out across a narrow stone-flagged yard at the blank face\nof a stable, pointed to look like the front of a miniature house.",
        "There\nwere no windows in it, so we were not afraid of being overlooked.",
        "We did\nnot lose any time in examining the chests.",
        "With the tools which we had\nbrought with us we opened them, one by one, and treated them as we had\ntreated those others in the chapel.",
        "It was evident to us that the Count\nwas not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for any of\nhis effects.",
        "After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms from basement to attic,\nwe came to the conclusion that the dining-room contained any effects\nwhich might belong to the Count; and so we proceeded to minutely examine\nthem.",
        "They lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining-room\ntable.",
        "There were title-deeds of the Piccadilly house in a great\nbundle; deeds of the purchase of the houses at Mile End and Bermondsey;\nnotepaper, envelopes, and pens and ink.",
        "All were covered up in thin\nwrapping paper to keep them from the dust.",
        "There were also a clothes\nbrush, a brush and comb, and a jug and basin--the latter containing\ndirty water which was reddened as if with blood.",
        "Last of all was a\nlittle heap of keys of all sorts and sizes, probably those belonging to\nthe other houses.",
        "When we had examined this last find, Lord Godalming\nand Quincey Morris, taking accurate notes of the various addresses of\nthe houses in the East and the South, took with them the keys in a great\nbunch, and set out to destroy the boxes in these places.",
        "The rest of us\nare, with what patience we can, awaiting their return--or the coming of\nthe Count.",

        "Seward\u2019s Diary./\n\n\n_3 October._--The time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for\nthe coming of Godalming and Quincey Morris.",
        "The Professor tried to keep\nour minds active by using them all the time.",
        "I could see his beneficent\npurpose, by the side glances which he threw from time to time at Harker.",
        "The poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see.",
        "Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong youthful face,\nfull of energy, and with dark brown hair.",
        "To-day he is a drawn, haggard\nold man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and\ngrief-written lines of his face.",
        "His energy is still intact; in fact he\nis like a living flame.",
        "This may yet be his salvation, for, if all go\nwell, it will tide him over the despairing period; he will then, in a\nkind of way, wake again to the realities of life.",
        "Poor fellow, I thought\nmy own trouble was bad enough, but his----!",
        "The Professor knows this\nwell enough, and is doing his best to keep his mind active.",
        "What he has\nbeen saying was, under the circumstances, of absorbing interest.",
        "As well\nas I can remember, here it is:--\n\n\u201cI have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands,\nall the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied,\nthe greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out.",
        "All through\nthere are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his\nknowledge of it.",
        "As I learned from the researches of my friend Arminius\nof Buda-Pesth, he was in life a most wonderful man.",
        "Soldier, statesman,\nand alchemist--which latter was the highest development of the\nscience-knowledge of his time.",
        "He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond\ncompare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse.",
        "He dared even\nto attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his\ntime that he did not essay.",
        "Well, in him the brain powers survived the\nphysical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete.",
        "In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is\ngrowing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of\nman\u2019s stature.",
        "He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not\nbeen that we have crossed his path he would be yet--he may be yet if we\nfail--the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must\nlead through Death, not Life.\u201d\n\nHarker groaned and said: \u201cAnd this is all arrayed against my darling!",
        "But how is he experimenting?",
        "The knowledge may help us to defeat him!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has all along, since his coming, been trying his power, slowly but\nsurely; that big child-brain of his is working.",
        "Well for us, it is, as\nyet, a child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain\nthings he would long ago have been beyond our power.",
        "However, he means\nto succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait\nand to go slow.",
        "_Festina lente_ may well be his motto.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fail to understand,\u201d said Harker wearily.",
        "\u201cOh, do be more plain to\nme!",
        "Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.\u201d The Professor laid\nhis hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:--\n\n\u201cAh, my child, I will be plain.",
        "Do you not see how, of late, this\nmonster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally?",
        "How he has been\nmaking use of the zoophagous patient to effect his entry into friend\nJohn\u2019s home; for your Vampire, though in all afterwards he can come when\nand how he will, must at the first make entry only when asked thereto\nby an inmate.",
        "But these are not his most important experiments.",
        "Do we\nnot see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others?",
        "He knew not then but that must be so.",
        "But all the time that so great\nchild-brain of his was growing, and he began to consider whether he\nmight not himself move the box.",
        "So he begin to help; and then, when he\nfound that this be all right, he try to move them all alone.",
        "And so he\nprogress, and he scatter these graves of him; and none but he know where\nthey are hidden.",
        "He may have intend to bury them deep in the ground.",
        "So that he only use them in the night, or at such time as he can change\nhis form, they do him equal well; and none may know these are his hiding\nplace!",
        "But, my child, do not despair; this knowledge come to him just\ntoo late!",
        "Already all of his lairs but one be sterilize as for him;\nand before the sunset this shall be so.",
        "Then he have no place where he\ncan move and hide.",
        "I delayed this morning that so we might be sure.",
        "Is\nthere not more at stake for us than for him?",
        "Then why we not be even\nmore careful than him?",
        "By my clock it is one hour, and already, if all\nbe well, friend Arthur and Quincey are on their way to us.",
        "To-day is our\nday, and we must go sure, if slow, and lose no chance.",
        "See!",
        "there are\nfive of us when those absent ones return.\u201d\n\nWhilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door,\nthe double postman\u2019s knock of the telegraph boy.",
        "We all moved out to\nthe hall with one impulse, and Van Helsing, holding up his hand to us\nto keep silence, stepped to the door and opened it.",
        "The boy handed in a\ndespatch.",
        "The Professor closed the door again and, after looking at the\ndirection, opened it and read it aloud:--\n\n\u201cLook out for D. He has just now, 12.45, come from Carfax hurriedly and\nhastened towards the south.",
        "He seems to be going the round and may want\nto see you: Mina.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, broken by Jonathan Harker\u2019s voice:--\n\n\u201cNow, God be thanked, we shall soon meet!\u201d Van Helsing turned to him\nquickly and said:--\n\n\u201cGod will act in His own way and time.",
        "Do not fear, and do not rejoice\nas yet; for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI care for nothing now,\u201d he answered hotly, \u201cexcept to wipe out this\nbrute from the face of creation.",
        "I would sell my soul to do it!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, hush, hush, my child!\u201d said Van Helsing, \u201cGod does not purchase\nsouls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not\nkeep faith.",
        "But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your\ndevotion to that dear Madam Mina.",
        "Think you, how her pain would be\ndoubled, did she but hear your wild words.",
        "Do not fear any of us; we\nare all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end.",
        "The time\nis coming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of\nman, and till sunset he may not change.",
        "It will take him time to arrive\nhere--see, it is twenty minutes past one--and there are yet some times\nbefore he can hither come, be he never so quick.",
        "What we must hope for\nis that my Lord Arthur and Quincey arrive first.\u201d\n\nAbout half an hour after we had received Mrs.",
        "Harker\u2019s telegram, there\ncame a quiet resolute knock at the hall door.",
        "It was just an ordinary\nknock, such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen, but it made\nthe Professor\u2019s heart and mine beat loudly.",
        "We looked at each other, and\ntogether moved out into the hall; we each held ready to use our various\narmaments--the spiritual in the left hand, the moral in the right.",
        "Van\nHelsing pulled back the latch, and, holding the door half open, stood\nback, having both hands ready for action.",
        "The gladness of our hearts\nmust have shown upon our faces when on the step, close to the door, we\nsaw Lord Godalming and Quincey Morris.",
        "They came quickly in and closed\nthe door behind them, the former saying, as they moved along the hall:--\n\n\u201cIt is all right.",
        "We found both places; six boxes in each, and we\ndestroyed them all!\u201d\n\n\u201cDestroyed?\u201d asked the Professor.",
        "\u201cFor him!\u201d We were silent for a minute, and then Quincey said:--\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do but to wait here.",
        "If, however, he doesn\u2019t turn up\nby five o\u2019clock, we must start off; for it won\u2019t do to leave Mrs.",
        "Harker\nalone after sunset.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will be here before long now,\u201d said Van Helsing, who had been\nconsulting his pocket-book.",
        "\u201c_Nota bene_, in Madam\u2019s telegram he went\nsouth from Carfax, that means he went to cross the river, and he could\nonly do so at slack of tide, which should be something before one\no\u2019clock.",
        "That he went south has a meaning for us.",
        "He is as yet only\nsuspicious; and he went from Carfax first to the place where he would\nsuspect interference least.",
        "You must have been at Bermondsey only a\nshort time before him.",
        "That he is not here already shows that he went\nto Mile End next.",
        "This took him some time; for he would then have to be\ncarried over the river in some way.",
        "Believe me, my friends, we shall not\nhave long to wait now.",
        "We should have ready some plan of attack, so that\nwe may throw away no chance.",
        "Hush, there is no time now.",
        "Have all your\narms!",
        "Be ready!\u201d He held up a warning hand as he spoke, for we all could\nhear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall-door.",
        "I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a\ndominant spirit asserted itself.",
        "In all our hunting parties and\nadventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always\nbeen the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been\naccustomed to obey him implicitly.",
        "Now, the old habit seemed to be\nrenewed instinctively.",
        "With a swift glance round the room, he at once\nlaid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a\ngesture, placed us each in position.",
        "Van Helsing, Harker, and I were\njust behind the door so that when it was opened the Professor could\nguard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door.",
        "Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready\nto move in front of the window.",
        "We waited in a suspence that made the\nseconds pass with nightmare slowness.",
        "The slow, careful steps came along\nthe hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least\nhe feared it.",
        "Suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room, winning a way\npast us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him.",
        "There was\nsomething so panther-like in the movement--something so unhuman, that it\nseemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming.",
        "The first to act\nwas Harker, who, with a quick movement, threw himself before the door\nleading into the room in the front of the house.",
        "As the Count saw us,\na horrible sort of snarl passed over his face, showing the eye-teeth\nlong and pointed; but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare\nof lion-like disdain.",
        "His expression again changed, as, with a single\nimpulse, we all advanced upon him.",
        "It was a pity that we had not some\nbetter organised plan of attack, for even at the moment I wondered what\nwe were to do.",
        "I did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would\navail us anything.",
        "Harker evidently meant to try the matter, for he\nhad ready his great Kukri knife, and made a fierce and sudden cut at\nhim.",
        "The blow was a powerful one; only the diabolical quickness of the\nCount\u2019s leap back saved him.",
        "A second less and the trenchant blade had\nshorn through his heart.",
        "As it was, the point just cut the cloth of his\ncoat, making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank-notes and a stream of\ngold fell out.",
        "The expression of the Count\u2019s face was so hellish, that\nfor a moment I feared for Harker, though I saw him throw the terrible\nknife aloft again for another stroke.",
        "Instinctively I moved forward with\na protective impulse, holding the crucifix and wafer in my left hand.",
        "I\nfelt a mighty power fly along my arm; and it was without surprise that I\nsaw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously\nby each one of us.",
        "It would be impossible to describe the expression of\nhate and baffled malignity--of anger and hellish rage--which came over\nthe Count\u2019s face.",
        "His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast\nof his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the\npallid skin like a palpitating wound.",
        "The next instant, with a sinuous\ndive he swept under Harker\u2019s arm ere his blow could fall, and, grasping\na handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, and\nthrew himself at the window.",
        "Amid the crash and glitter of the falling\nglass, he tumbled into the flagged area below.",
        "Through the sound of the\nshivering glass I could hear the \u201cting\u201d of the gold, as some of the\nsovereigns fell on the flagging.",
        "We ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground.",
        "He, rushing up\nthe steps, crossed the flagged yard, and pushed open the stable door.",
        "There he turned and spoke to us:--\n\n\u201cYou think to baffle me, you----with your pale faces all in a row,\nlike sheep in a butcher\u2019s.",
        "You shall be sorry yet, each one of you!",
        "You\nthink you have left me without a place to rest; but I have more.",
        "My\nrevenge is just begun!",
        "I spread it over centuries, and time is on my\nside.",
        "Your girls that you all love are mine already; and through them\nyou and others shall yet be mine--my creatures, to do my bidding and to\nbe my jackals when I want to feed.",
        "Bah!\u201d With a contemptuous sneer, he\npassed quickly through the door, and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he\nfastened it behind him.",
        "A door beyond opened and shut.",
        "The first of us\nto speak was the Professor, as, realising the difficulty of following\nhim through the stable, we moved towards the hall.",
        "\u201cWe have learnt something--much!",
        "Notwithstanding his brave words, he\nfears us; he fear time, he fear want!",
        "For if not, why he hurry so?",
        "His\nvery tone betray him, or my ears deceive.",
        "Why take that money?",
        "You\nfollow quick.",
        "You are hunters of wild beast, and understand it so.",
        "For\nme, I make sure that nothing here may be of use to him, if so that he\nreturn.\u201d As he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket; took\nthe title-deeds in the bundle as Harker had left them, and swept the\nremaining things into the open fireplace, where he set fire to them with\na match.",
        "Godalming and Morris had rushed out into the yard, and Harker had\nlowered himself from the window to follow the Count.",
        "He had, however,\nbolted the stable door; and by the time they had forced it open there\nwas no sign of him.",
        "Van Helsing and I tried to make inquiry at the back\nof the house; but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart.",
        "It was now late in the afternoon, and sunset was not far off.",
        "We had to\nrecognise that our game was up; with heavy hearts we agreed with the\nProfessor when he said:--\n\n\u201cLet us go back to Madam Mina--poor, poor, dear Madam Mina.",
        "All we can\ndo just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her.",
        "But we\nneed not despair.",
        "There is but one more earth-box, and we must try to\nfind it; when that is done all may yet be well.\u201d I could see that he\nspoke as bravely as he could to comfort Harker.",
        "The poor fellow was\nquite broken down; now and again he gave a low groan which he could not\nsuppress--he was thinking of his wife.",
        "With sad hearts we came back to my house, where we found Mrs.",
        "Harker\nawaiting us, with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her\nbravery and unselfishness.",
        "When she saw our faces, her own became as\npale as death; for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were\nin secret prayer; and then she said cheerfully:--\n\n\u201cI can never thank you all enough.",
        "Oh, my poor darling!\u201d as she spoke\nshe took her husband\u2019s grey head in her hands and kissed it--\u201cLay your\npoor head here and rest it.",
        "All will yet be well, dear!",
        "God will protect\nus if He so will it in His good intent.\u201d The poor fellow only groaned.",
        "There was no place for words in his sublime misery.",
        "We had a sort of perfunctory supper together, and I think it cheered\nus all up somewhat.",
        "It was, perhaps, the mere animal heat of food to\nhungry people--for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast--or\nthe sense of companionship may have helped us; but anyhow we were all\nless miserable, and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope.",

        "She said nothing, however,\ntill the narration was all done, and matters had been brought right\nup to the present time.",
        "Then without letting go her husband\u2019s hand\nshe stood up amongst us and spoke.",
        "Oh that I could give any idea of\nthe scene; of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant\nbeauty of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead\nof which she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our\nteeth--remembering whence and how it came; her loving kindness against\nour grim hate; her tender faith against all our fears and doubting; and\nwe, knowing that, so far as symbols went, she with all her goodness and\npurity and faith, was outcast from God.",
        "\u201cJonathan,\u201d she said, and the word sounded like music on her lips, it\nwas so full of love and tenderness, \u201cJonathan dear, and you all, my\ntrue, true friends, I want you to bear something in mind through all\nthis dreadful time.",
        "I know that you must fight--that you must destroy\neven as you destroyed the false Lucy so that the true Lucy might live\nhereafter; but it is not a work of hate.",

        "You must be pitiful to him too, though it\nmay not hold your hands from his destruction.\u201d\n\nAs she spoke I could see her husband\u2019s face darken and draw together,\nas though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core.",
        "Instinctively the clasp on his wife\u2019s hand grew closer, till his\nknuckles looked white.",
        "She did not flinch from the pain which I knew she\nmust have suffered, but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing\nthan ever.",
        "As she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet, almost\ntearing his hand from hers as he spoke:--\n\n\u201cMay God give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that\nearthly life of him which we are aiming at.",
        "If beyond it I could send\nhis soul for ever and ever to burning hell I would do it!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, hush!",
        "oh, hush!",
        "in the name of the good God.",
        "Don\u2019t say such things,\nJonathan, my husband; or you will crush me with fear and horror.",
        "Just\nthink, my dear--I have been thinking all this long, long day of it--that\n... perhaps ... some day ... I too may need such pity; and that some\nother like you--and with equal cause for anger--may deny it to me!",
        "Oh,\nmy husband!",
        "my husband, indeed I would have spared you such a thought\nhad there been another way; but I pray that God may not have treasured\nyour wild words, except as the heartbroken wail of a very loving and\nsorely stricken man.",
        "Oh God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence\nof what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom\nso many sorrows have come.\u201d\n\nWe men were all in tears now.",
        "There was no resisting them, and we wept\nopenly.",
        "She wept too, to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed.",
        "Her husband flung himself on his knees beside her, and putting his arms\nround her, hid his face in the folds of her dress.",
        "Van Helsing beckoned\nto us and we stole out of the room, leaving the two loving hearts alone\nwith God.",
        "Before they retired the Professor fixed up the room against any coming\nof the Vampire, and assured Mrs.",
        "Harker that she might rest in peace.",
        "She tried to school herself to the belief, and, manifestly for her\nhusband\u2019s sake, tried to seem content.",
        "It was a brave struggle; and was,\nI think and believe, not without its reward.",
        "Van Helsing had placed at\nhand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency.",
        "When they had retired, Quincey, Godalming, and I arranged that we should\nsit up, dividing the night between us, and watch over the safety of the\npoor stricken lady.",

        "There was over me a yearning for sleep in some sort of blind belief\nthat to wake would be to find things changed, and that any change\nmust now be for the better.",

        "I thought at the time that it was the\nsoftness of the red sunset on her face, but somehow now I think it had\na deeper meaning.",
        "I am not sleepy myself, though I am weary--weary to\ndeath.",

        "He go there, and soon he come again,\nhimself driving cart on which is a great box; this he himself lift\ndown, though it take several to put it on truck for the ship.",
        "He give\nmuch talk to captain as to how and where his box is to be place; but\nthe captain like it not and swear at him in many tongues, and tell him\nthat if he like he can come and see where it shall be.",
        "But he say \u2018no;\u2019\nthat he come not yet, for that he have much to do.",
        "Whereupon the captain\ntell him that he had better be quick--with blood--for that his ship will\nleave the place--of blood--before the turn of the tide--with blood.",
        "Then\nthe thin man smile, and say that of course he must go when he think\nfit; but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon.",
        "The captain swear\nagain, polyglot, and the thin man make him bow, and thank him, and say\nthat he will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the\nsailing.",
        "Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues,\ntell him that he doesn\u2019t want no Frenchmen--with bloom upon them and\nalso with blood--in his ship--with blood on her also.",
        "And so, after\nasking where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase\nships forms, he departed.",
        "\u201cNo one knew where he went \u2018or bloomin\u2019 well cared,\u2019 as they said, for\nthey had something else to think of--well with blood again; for it soon\nbecame apparent to all that the _Czarina Catherine_ would not sail as\nwas expected.",
        "A thin mist began to creep up from the river, and it\ngrew, and grew; till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around\nher.",
        "The captain swore polyglot--very polyglot--polyglot with bloom and\nblood; but he could do nothing.",
        "The water rose and rose; and he began\nto fear that he would lose the tide altogether.",
        "He was in no friendly\nmood, when just at full tide, the thin man came up the gang-plank\nagain and asked to see where his box had been stowed.",
        "Then the captain\nreplied that he wished that he and his box--old and with much bloom and\nblood--were in hell.",
        "But the thin man did not be offend, and went down\nwith the mate and saw where it was place, and came up and stood awhile\non deck in fog.",
        "He must have come off by himself, for none notice him.",
        "Indeed they thought not of him; for soon the fog begin to melt away,\nand all was clear again.",
        "My friends of the thirst and the language\nthat was of bloom and blood laughed, as they told how the captain\u2019s\nswears exceeded even his usual polyglot, and was more than ever full of\npicturesque, when on questioning other mariners who were in movement up\nand down the river that hour, he found that few of them had seen any of\nfog at all, except where it lay round the wharf.",
        "However the ship went\nout on the ebb tide; and was doubtless by morning far down the river\nmouth.",
        "She was by then, when they told us, well out to sea.",
        "\u201cAnd so, my dear Madam Mina, it is that we have to rest for a time, for\nour enemy is on the sea, with the fog at his command, on his way to the\nDanube mouth.",
        "To sail a ship takes time, go she never so quick; and when\nwe start we go on land more quick, and we meet him there.",
        "Our best hope\nis to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset; for then\nhe can make no struggle, and we may deal with him as we should.",
        "There\nare days for us in which we can make ready our plan.",
        "We know all about\nwhere he go; for we have seen the owner of the ship, who have shown us\ninvoices and all papers that can be.",
        "The box we seek is to be landed in\nVarna, and to be given to an agent, one Ristics who will there present\nhis credentials; and so our merchant friend will have done his part.",
        "When he ask if there be any wrong, for that so, he can telegraph and\nhave inquiry made at Varna, we say \u2018no;\u2019 for what is to be done is not\nfor police or of the customs.",
        "It must be done by us alone and in our own\nway.\u201d\n\nWhen Dr.",
        "Van Helsing had done speaking, I asked him if it were certain\nthat the Count had remained on board the ship.",
        "He replied: \u201cWe have\nthe best proof of that: your own evidence, when in the hypnotic trance\nthis morning.\u201d I asked him again if it were really necessary that they\nshould pursue the Count, for oh!",
        "I dread Jonathan leaving me, and I\nknow that he would surely go if the others went.",
        "He answered in growing\npassion, at first quietly.",
        "As he went on, however, he grew more angry\nand more forceful, till in the end we could not but see wherein was at\nleast some of that personal dominance which made him so long a master\namongst men:--\n\n\u201cYes, it is necessary--necessary--necessary!",
        "For your sake in the first,\nand then for the sake of humanity.",
        "This monster has done much harm\nalready, in the narrow scope where he find himself, and in the short\ntime when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in\ndarkness and not knowing.",
        "All this have I told these others; you, my\ndear Madam Mina, will learn it in the phonograph of my friend John, or\nin that of your husband.",
        "I have told them how the measure of leaving his\nown barren land--barren of peoples--and coming to a new land where life\nof man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn, was the\nwork of centuries.",
        "Were another of the Un-Dead, like him, to try to do\nwhat he has done, perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have\nbeen, or that will be, could aid him.",
        "With this one, all the forces of\nnature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in\nsome wondrous way.",
        "The very place where he have been alive, Un-Dead for\nall these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical\nworld.",
        "There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither.",
        "There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters\nof strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify.",
        "Doubtless,\nthere is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations\nof occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in\nhimself were from the first some great qualities.",
        "In a hard and warlike\ntime he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain,\nmore braver heart, than any man.",
        "In him some vital principle have in\nstrange way found their utmost; and as his body keep strong and grow and\nthrive, so his brain grow too.",
        "All this without that diabolic aid which\nis surely to him; for it have to yield to the powers that come from, and\nare, symbolic of good.",
        "And now this is what he is to us.",
        "He have infect\nyou--oh, forgive me, my dear, that I must say such; but it is for good\nof you that I speak.",
        "He infect you in such wise, that even if he do no\nmore, you have only to live--to live in your own old, sweet way; and so\nin time, death, which is of man\u2019s common lot and with God\u2019s sanction,\nshall make you like to him.",
        "This must not be!",
        "We have sworn together\nthat it must not.",
        "Thus are we ministers of God\u2019s own wish: that the\nworld, and men for whom His Son die, will not be given over to monsters,\nwhose very existence would defame Him.",
        "He have allowed us to redeem one\nsoul already, and we go out as the old knights of the Cross to redeem\nmore.",
        "Like them we shall travel towards the sunrise; and like them, if\nwe fall, we fall in good cause.\u201d He paused and I said:--\n\n\u201cBut will not the Count take his rebuff wisely?",
        "Since he has been driven\nfrom England, will he not avoid it, as a tiger does the village from\nwhich he has been hunted?\u201d\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d he said, \u201cyour simile of the tiger good, for me, and I shall\nadopt him.",
        "Your man-eater, as they of India call the tiger who has\nonce taste blood of the human, care no more for other prey, but prowl\nunceasing till he get him.",
        "This that we hunt from our village is a\ntiger, too, a man-eater, and he never cease to prowl.",
        "Nay, in himself he\nis not one to retire and stay afar.",
        "In his life, his living life, he go\nover the Turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground; he be\nbeaten back, but did he stay?",
        "No!",
        "He come again, and again, and again.",
        "Look at his persistence and endurance.",
        "With the child-brain that was\nto him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city.",
        "What does he do?",
        "He find out the place of all the world most of promise\nfor him.",
        "Then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task.",
        "He find in patience just how is his strength, and what are his powers.",
        "He study new tongues.",

        "His glimpse\nthat he have had, whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire.",
        "Nay, it\nhelp him to grow as to his brain; for it all prove to him how right he\nwas at the first in his surmises.",
        "He have done this alone; all alone!",
        "from a ruin tomb in a forgotten land.",
        "What more may he not do when the\ngreater world of thought is open to him?",
        "He that can smile at death, as\nwe know him; who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off\nwhole peoples.",
        "Oh!",

        "But we are pledged to set the world free.",
        "Our toil must be in silence,\nand our efforts all in secret; for this enlightened age, when men\nbelieve not even what they see, the doubting of wise men would be his\ngreatest strength.",
        "It would be at once his sheath and his armour, and\nhis weapons to destroy us, his enemies, who are willing to peril even\nour own souls for the safety of one we love--for the good of mankind,\nand for the honour and glory of God.\u201d\n\nAfter a general discussion it was determined that for to-night nothing\nbe definitely settled; that we should all sleep on the facts, and try to\nthink out the proper conclusions.",
        "To-morrow at breakfast we are to meet\nagain, and, after making our conclusions known to one another, we shall\ndecide on some definite course of action.",
        "*       *       *       *       *\n\nI feel a wonderful peace and rest to-night.",
        "It is as if some haunting\npresence were removed from me.",
        "Perhaps....\n\nMy surmise was not finished, could not be; for I caught sight in the\nmirror of the red mark upon my forehead; and I knew that I was still\nunclean.",

        "Let any obstructing cause, no matter what, be removed in any way--even\nby death--and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment.",
        "More than once as we sat around the table, my eyes opened in wonder\nwhether the whole of the past days had not been a dream.",

        "Harker seems to lose sight of\nher trouble for whole spells; it is only now and again, when something\nrecalls it to her mind, that she thinks of her terrible scar.",

        "I see only one immediate difficulty, I know it by instinct\nrather than reason: we shall all have to speak frankly; and yet I fear\nthat in some mysterious way poor Mrs.",
        "Harker\u2019s tongue is tied.",
        "I _know_\nthat she forms conclusions of her own, and from all that has been I can\nguess how brilliant and how true they must be; but she will not, or\ncannot, give them utterance.",
        "I have mentioned this to Van Helsing, and\nhe and I are to talk it over when we are alone.",
        "I suppose it is some of\nthat horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work.",
        "The\nCount had his own purposes when he gave her what Van Helsing called \u201cthe\nVampire\u2019s baptism of blood.\u201d Well, there may be a poison that distils\nitself out of good things; in an age when the existence of ptomaines is\na mystery we should not wonder at anything!",
        "One thing I know: that if my\ninstinct be true regarding poor Mrs.",

        "I shall\ntry to open the subject with him.",
        "_Later._--When the Professor came in, we talked over the state of\nthings.",
        "I could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted\nto say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject.",
        "After\nbeating about the bush a little, he said suddenly:--\n\n\u201cFriend John, there is something that you and I must talk of alone,\njust at the first at any rate.",
        "Later, we may have to take the others\ninto our confidence;\u201d then he stopped, so I waited; he went on:--\n\n\u201cMadam Mina, our poor, dear Madam Mina, is changing.\u201d A cold shiver\nran through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed.",
        "Van Helsing\ncontinued:--\n\n\u201cWith the sad experience of Miss Lucy, we must this time be warned\nbefore things go too far.",
        "Our task is now in reality more difficult than\never, and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance.",
        "I\ncan see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face.",
        "It is now\nbut very, very slight; but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice\nwithout to prejudge.",
        "Her teeth are some sharper, and at times her eyes\nare more hard.",
        "But these are not all, there is to her the silence now\noften; as so it was with Miss Lucy.",
        "She did not speak, even when she\nwrote that which she wished to be known later.",
        "Now my fear is this.",
        "If\nit be that she can, by our hypnotic trance, tell what the Count see and\nhear, is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first, and who\nhave drink of her very blood and make her drink of his, should, if he\nwill, compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know?\u201d I nodded\nacquiescence; he went on:--\n\n\u201cThen what we must do is to prevent this; we must keep her ignorant of\nour intent, and so she cannot tell what she know not.",
        "This is a painful\ntask!",
        "Oh!",
        "so painful that it heartbreak me to think of; but it must be.",
        "When to-day we meet, I must tell her that for reason which we will not\nto speak she must not more be of our council, but be simply guarded by\nus.\u201d He wiped his forehead, which had broken out in profuse perspiration\nat the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor\nsoul already so tortured.",
        "I knew that it would be some sort of comfort\nto him if I told him that I also had come to the same conclusion; for\nat any rate it would take away the pain of doubt.",
        "I told him, and the\neffect was as I expected.",
        "It is now close to the time of our general gathering.",
        "Van Helsing has\ngone away to prepare for the meeting, and his painful part of it.",
        "I\nreally believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone.",
        "_Later._--At the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief\nwas experienced by both Van Helsing and myself.",
        "Mrs.",
        "Harker had sent a\nmessage by her husband to say that she would not join us at present, as\nshe thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements\nwithout her presence to embarrass us.",
        "The Professor and I looked at\neach other for an instant, and somehow we both seemed relieved.",
        "For my\nown part, I thought that if Mrs.",
        "Harker realised the danger herself, it\nwas much pain as well as much danger averted.",
        "Under the circumstances\nwe agreed, by a questioning look and answer, with finger on lip, to\npreserve silence of our suspicions, until we should have been able to\nconfer alone again.",
        "We went at once into our Plan of Campaign.",
        "Van\nHelsing roughly put the facts before us first:--\n\n\u201cThe _Czarina Catherine_ left the Thames yesterday morning.",
        "It will\ntake her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks\nto reach Varna; but we can travel overland to the same place in three\ndays.",
        "Now, if we allow for two days less for the ship\u2019s voyage, owing\nto such weather influences as we know that the Count can bring to bear;\nand if we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur\nto us, then we have a margin of nearly two weeks.",
        "Thus, in order to be\nquite safe, we must leave here on 17th at latest.",
        "Then we shall at any\nrate be in Varna a day before the ship arrives, and able to make such\npreparations as may be necessary.",
        "Of course we shall all go armed--armed\nagainst evil things, spiritual as well as physical.\u201d Here Quincey Morris\nadded:--\n\n\u201cI understand that the Count comes from a wolf country, and it may be\nthat he will get there before us.",
        "I propose that we add Winchesters to\nour armament.",
        "I have a kind of belief in a Winchester when there is any\ntrouble of that sort around.",
        "Do you remember, Art, when we had the pack\nafter us at Tobolsk?",
        "What wouldn\u2019t we have given then for a repeater\napiece!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d said Van Helsing.",
        "\u201cWinchesters it shall be.",
        "Quincey\u2019s head\nis level at all times, but most so when there is to hunt, though my\nmetaphor be more dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man.",
        "In the meantime we can do nothing here; and as I think that Varna is not\nfamiliar to any of us, why not go there more soon?",
        "It is as long to wait\nhere as there.",
        "To-night and to-morrow we can get ready, and then, if all\nbe well, we four can set out on our journey.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe four?\u201d said Harker interrogatively, looking from one to another of\nus.",
        "\u201cOf course!\u201d answered the Professor quickly.",
        "\u201cYou must remain to take\ncare of your so sweet wife!\u201d Harker was silent for a while and then said\nin a hollow voice:--\n\n\u201cLet us talk of that part of it in the morning.",
        "I want to consult with\nMina.\u201d I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not\nto disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice.",
        "I looked at him\nsignificantly and coughed.",
        "For answer he put his finger on his lip and\nturned away.",
        "/Jonathan Harker\u2019s Journal./\n\n_5 October, afternoon._--For some time after our meeting this morning I\ncould not think.",
        "The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of\nwonder which allows no room for active thought.",
        "Mina\u2019s determination\nnot to take any part in the discussion set me thinking; and as I could\nnot argue the matter with her, I could only guess.",
        "I am as far as ever\nfrom a solution now.",
        "The way the others received it, too, puzzled me;\nthe last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no\nmore concealment of anything amongst us.",
        "Mina is sleeping now, calmly\nand sweetly like a little child.",
        "Her lips are curved and her face beams\nwith happiness.",
        "Thank God there are such moments still for her.",
        "_Later._--How strange it all is.",
        "I sat watching Mina\u2019s happy sleep, and\ncame as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be.",
        "As the\nevening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking\nlower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me.",
        "All at\nonce Mina opened her eyes, and looking at me tenderly, said:--\n\n\u201cJonathan, I want you to promise me something on your word of honour.",
        "A promise made to me, but made holily in God\u2019s hearing, and not to be\nbroken though I should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter\ntears.",
        "Quick, you must make it to me at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cMina,\u201d I said, \u201ca promise like that, I cannot make at once.",
        "I may have\nno right to make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, dear one,\u201d she said, with such spiritual intensity that her eyes\nwere like pole stars, \u201cit is I who wish it; and it is not for myself.",
        "You can ask Dr.",
        "Van Helsing if I am not right; if he disagrees you may\ndo as you will.",
        "Nay, more, if you all agree, later, you are absolved\nfrom the promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise!\u201d I said, and for a moment she looked supremely happy; though\nto me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead.",
        "She said:--\n\n\u201cPromise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed\nfor the campaign against the Count.",
        "Not by word, or inference, or\nimplication; not at any time whilst this remains to me!\u201d and she\nsolemnly pointed to the scar.",
        "I saw that she was in earnest, and said\nsolemnly:--\n\n\u201cI promise!\u201d and as I said it I felt that from that instant a door had\nbeen shut between us.",
        "_Later, midnight._--Mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening.",
        "So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected\nsomewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall\nof gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted.",
        "We all retired\nearly.",
        "Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing\nthat her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible\ntrouble.",
        "Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care.",
        "Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night.",
        "I shall\ntry it.",
        "Oh!",
        "for a dreamless sleep.",
        "_6 October, morning._--Another surprise.",
        "Mina woke me early, about the\nsame time as yesterday, and asked me to bring Dr.",
        "Van Helsing.",
        "I thought\nthat it was another occasion for hypnotism, and without question went\nfor the Professor.",
        "He had evidently expected some such call, for I found\nhim dressed in his room.",
        "His door was ajar, so that he could hear the\nopening of the door of our room.",
        "He came at once; as he passed into the\nroom, he asked Mina if the others might come too.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d she said quite simply, \u201cit will not be necessary.",
        "You can tell\nthem just as well.",

        "We men are all in a fever of\nexcitement, except Harker, who is calm; his hands are as cold as ice,\nand an hour ago I found him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka knife\nwhich he now always carries with him.",
        "It will be a bad look out for the\nCount if the edge of that \u201cK\u00fakri\u201d ever touches his throat, driven by\nthat stern, ice-cold hand!",
        "Van Helsing and I were a little alarmed about Mrs.",
        "Harker to-day.",
        "About\nnoon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like; although we\nkept silent to the others, we were neither of us happy about it.",
        "She had\nbeen restless all the morning, so that we were at first glad to know\nthat she was sleeping.",
        "When, however, her husband mentioned casually\nthat she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her, we went to\nher room to see for ourselves.",
        "She was breathing naturally and looked so\nwell and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than\nanything else.",
        "Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is no wonder\nthat sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her good.",
        "_Later._--Our opinion was justified, for when after a refreshing sleep\nof some hours she woke up, she seemed brighter and better than she has\nbeen for days.",
        "At sunset she made the usual hypnotic report.",
        "Wherever he\nmay be in the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination.",
        "To\nhis doom, I trust!",
        "_26 October._--Another day and no tidings of the _Czarina Catherine_.",
        "She ought to be here by now.",
        "That she is still journeying _somewhere_\nis apparent, for Mrs.",
        "Harker\u2019s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the\nsame.",
        "It is possible that the vessel may be lying by, at times, for fog;\nsome of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog\nboth to north and south of the port.",
        "We must continue our watching, as\nthe ship may now be signalled any moment.",
        "_27 October, Noon._--Most strange; no news yet of the ship we wait for.",
        "Mrs.",
        "Harker reported last night and this morning as usual: \u201clapping\nwaves and rushing water,\u201d though she added that \u201cthe waves were very\nfaint.\u201d The telegrams from London have been the same: \u201cno further\nreport.\u201d Van Helsing is terribly anxious, and told me just now that he\nfears the Count is escaping us.",
        "He added significantly:--\n\n\u201cI did not like that lethargy of Madam Mina\u2019s.",
        "Souls and memories can do\nstrange things during trance.\u201d I was about to ask him more, but Harker\njust then came in, and he held up a warning hand.",
        "We must try to-night,\nat sunset, to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state.",
        "_28 October._--Telegram.",
        "_Rufus Smith, London, to Lord Godalming, care\nof H.B.M.",

        "True, we did not know whence, or how, or when, the bolt would\ncome; but I think we all expected that something strange would happen.",
        "The delay of arrival at Varna made us individually satisfied that things\nwould not be just as we had expected; we only waited to learn where the\nchange would occur.",
        "None the less, however, was it a surprise.",
        "I suppose\nthat nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against\nourselves that things will be as they ought to be, not as we should\nknow that they will be.",
        "Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels,\neven if it be a will-o\u2019-the-wisp to man.",
        "It was an odd experience, and\nwe all took it differently.",
        "Van Helsing raised his hands over his head\nfor a moment, as though in remonstrance with the Almighty; but he said\nnot a word, and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set.",
        "Lord Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily.",
        "I was myself\nhalf stunned and looked in wonder at one after another.",
        "Quincey Morris\ntightened his belt with that quick movement which I knew so well; in our\nold wandering days it meant \u201caction.\u201d Mrs.",
        "Harker grew ghastly white, so\nthat the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded her hands\nmeekly and looked up in prayer.",
        "Harker smiled--actually smiled--the dark\nbitter smile of one who is without hope; but at the same time his action\nbelied his words, for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the\ngreat Kukri knife and rested there.",
        "\u201cWhen does the next train start for\nGalatz?\u201d said Van Helsing to us generally.",
        "\u201cAt 6.30 to-morrow morning!\u201d We all stared, for the answer came from\nMrs.",

        "I found it so useful sometimes, that I always make a study of\nthe time-tables now.",
        "I knew that if anything were to take us to Castle\nDracula we should go by Galatz, or at any rate through Bucharest, so I\nlearned the times very carefully.",
        "Unhappily there are not many to learn,\nas the only train to-morrow leaves as I say.\u201d\n\n\u201cWonderful woman!\u201d murmured the Professor.",
        "\u201cCan\u2019t we get a special?\u201d asked Lord Godalming.",
        "Van Helsing shook his\nhead: \u201cI fear not.",
        "This land is very different from yours or mine; even\nif we did have a special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our\nregular train.",
        "Moreover, we have something to prepare.",
        "We must think.",
        "Now let us organize.",
        "You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the\ntickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning.",
        "Do\nyou, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him\nletters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship\njust as it was here.",
        "Quincey Morris, you see the Vice-Consul, and get\nhis aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way\nsmooth, so that no times be lost when over the Danube.",
        "John will stay\nwith Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult.",
        "For so if time be long you\nmay be delayed; and it will not matter when the sun set, since I am here\nwith Madam to make report.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I,\u201d said Mrs.",
        "Harker brightly, and more like her old self than she\nhad been for many a long day, \u201cshall try to be of use in all ways, and\nshall think and write for you as I used to do.",
        "Something is shifting\nfrom me in some strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!\u201d\nThe three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to\nrealise the significance of her words; but Van Helsing and I, turning to\neach other, met each a grave and troubled glance.",
        "We said nothing at the\ntime, however.",
        "When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.",
        "Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of\nHarker\u2019s journal at the castle.",
        "She went away to get it; when the door\nwas shut upon her he said to me:--\n\n\u201cWe mean the same!",
        "speak out!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is some change.",
        "It is a hope that makes me sick, for it may\ndeceive us.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite so.",
        "Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said I, \u201cunless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are in part right, friend John, but only in part.",
        "I want to tell\nyou something.",
        "And oh, my friend, I am taking a great--a terrible--risk;\nbut I believe it is right.",
        "In the moment when Madam Mina said those\nwords that arrest both our understanding, an inspiration come to me.",
        "In\nthe trance of three days ago the Count sent her his spirit to read her\nmind; or more like he took her to see him in his earth-box in the ship\nwith water rushing, just as it go free at rise and set of sun.",
        "He learn\nthen that we are here; for she have more to tell in her open life with\neyes to see and ears to hear than he, shut, as he is, in his coffin-box.",
        "Now he make his most effort to escape us.",
        "At present he want her not.",
        "He is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call;\nbut he cut her off--take her, as he can do, out of his own power, that\nso she come not to him.",
        "Ah!",
        "there I have hope that our man-brains that\nhave been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will\ncome higher than his child-brain that he in his tomb for centuries, that\ngrow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and therefore\nsmall.",
        "Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance!",
        "She know\nit not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when we want\nall her hope, all her courage; when most we want all her great brain\nwhich is trained like man\u2019s brain, but is of sweet woman and have a\nspecial power which the Count give her, and which he may not take away\naltogether--though he think not so.",
        "Hush!",
        "let me speak, and you shall\nlearn.",
        "Oh, John, my friend, we are in awful straits.",
        "I fear, as I never\nfeared before.",
        "We can only trust the good God.",
        "Silence!",
        "here she comes!\u201d\n\nI thought that the Professor was going to break down and have hysterics,\njust as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled\nhimself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs.",
        "Harker tripped into\nthe room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly\nforgetful of her misery.",
        "As she came in, she handed a number of sheets\nof typewriting to Van Helsing.",
        "He looked over them gravely, his face\nbrightening up as he read.",
        "Then, holding the pages between his finger\nand thumb, he said:--\n\n\u201cFriend John, to you with so much of experience already--and you too,\ndear Madam Mina, that are young--here is a lesson: do not fear ever to\nthink.",
        "A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to\nlet him loose his wings.",
        "Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to\nwhere that half-thought come from, and I find that he be no half-thought\nat all; that he be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet\nstrong to use his little wings.",
        "Nay, like the \u201cUgly Duck\u201d of my friend\nHans Andersen, he be no duck-thought at all, but a big swan-thought that\nsail nobly on big wings, when the time come for him to try them.",
        "See I\nread here what Jonathan have written:--\n\n\u201cThat other of his race who, in a later age, again and again, brought\nhis forces over the Great River into Turkey Land; who, when he was\nbeaten back, came again, and again, and again, though he had to come\nalone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered,\nsince he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does this tell us?",
        "Not much!",
        "no!",
        "The Count\u2019s child-thought see\nnothing; therefore he speak so free.",
        "Your man-thought see nothing; my\nman-thought see nothing, till just now.",
        "No!",
        "But there comes another\nword from some one who speak without thought because she too know not\nwhat it mean--what it _might_ mean.",
        "Just as there are elements which\nrest, yet when in nature\u2019s course they move on their way and they\ntouch--then pouf!",
        "and there comes a flash of light, heaven\u2019s wide,\nthat blind and kill and destroy some; but that show up all earth\nbelow for leagues and leagues.",
        "Is it not so?",
        "Well, I shall explain.",
        "To begin, have you ever study the philosophy of crime?",
        "\u2018Yes\u2019 and\n\u2018No.\u2019 You, John, yes; for it is a study of insanity.",
        "You, no, Madam\nMina; for crime touch you not--not but once.",
        "Still, your mind works\ntrue, and argues not _a particulari ad universale_.",
        "There is this\npeculiarity in criminals.",
        "It is so constant, in all countries and\nat all times, that even police, who know not much from philosophy,\ncome to know it empirically, that _it is_.",
        "That is to be empiric.",
        "The\ncriminal always work at one crime--that is the true criminal who seems\npredestinate to crime, and who will of none other.",
        "This criminal has\nnot full man-brain.",
        "He is clever and cunning and resourceful; but\nhe be not of man-stature as to brain.",
        "He be of child-brain in much.",
        "Now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime also; he too have\nchild-brain, and it is of the child to do what he have done.",
        "The little\nbird, the little fish, the little animal learn not by principle, but\nempirically; and when he learn to do, then there is to him the ground\nto start from to do more.",

        "\u2018Give me\na fulcrum, and I shall move the world!\u2019 To do once, is the fulcrum\nwhereby child-brain become man-brain; and until he have the purpose to\ndo more, he continue to do the same again every time, just as he have\ndone before!",
        "Oh, my dear, I see that your eyes are opened, and that to\nyou the lightning flash show all the leagues,\u201d for Mrs.",
        "Harker began to\nclap her hands, and her eyes sparkled.",
        "He went on:--\n\n\u201cNow you shall speak.",
        "Tell us two dry men of science what you see with\nthose so bright eyes.\u201d He took her hand and held it whilst she spoke.",
        "His finger and thumb closed on her pulse, as I thought instinctively and\nunconsciously, as she spoke:--\n\n\u201cThe Count is a criminal and of criminal type.",
        "Nordau and Lombroso\nwould so classify him, and _qua_ criminal he is of imperfectly formed\nmind.",
        "Thus, in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit.",
        "His past\nis a clue, and the one page of it that we know--and that from his own\nlips--tells that once before, when in what Mr.",
        "Morris would call a\n\u2018tight place,\u2019 he went back to his own country from the land he had\ntried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared himself\nfor a new effort.",
        "He came again, better equipped for his work; and won.",
        "So he came to London to invade a new land.",
        "He was beaten, and when all\nhope of success was lost, and his existence in danger, he fled back over\nthe sea to his home; just as formerly he had fled back over the Danube\nfrom Turkey land.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood, good!",
        "oh, you so clever lady!\u201d said Van Helsing,\nenthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand.",
        "A moment later\nhe said to me, as calmly as though we had been having a sick-room\nconsultation:--\n\n\u201cSeventy-two only; and in all this excitement.",
        "I have hope.\u201d Turning to\nher again, he said with keen expectation:--\n\n\u201cBut go on.",
        "Go on!",
        "there is more to tell if you will.",
        "Be not afraid;\nJohn and I know.",
        "I do in any case, and shall tell you if you are right.",
        "Speak, without fear!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will try to; but you will forgive me if I seem egotistical.\u201d\n\n\u201cNay!",
        "fear not, you must be egotist, for it is of you that we think.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen, as he is criminal he is selfish; and as his intellect is small\nand his action is based on selfishness, he confines himself to one\npurpose.",
        "That purpose is remorseless.",
        "As he fled back over the Danube,\nleaving his forces to be cut to pieces, so now he is intent on being\nsafe, careless of all.",
        "So, his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat of\nthe terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night.",
        "I\nfelt it, Oh!",
        "I felt it.",
        "Thank God for His great mercy!",
        "My soul is freer\nthan it has been since that awful hour; and all that haunts me is a\nfear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for his\nends.\u201d The Professor stood up:--\n\n\u201cHe has so used your mind; and by it he has left us here in Varna,\nwhilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to\nGalatz, where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping from\nus.",
        "But his child-mind only saw so far; and it may be that, as ever is\nin God\u2019s Providence, the very thing that the evil doer most reckoned\non for his selfish good, turns out to be his chiefest harm.",
        "The hunter\nis taken in his own snare, as the great Psalmist says.",
        "For now that he\nthink he is free from every trace of us all, and that he has escaped us\nwith so many hours to him, then his selfish child-brain will whisper him\nto sleep.",
        "He think, too, that as he cut himself off from knowing your\nmind, there can be no knowledge of him to you; there is where he fail!",
        "That terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to\nhim in spirit, as you have as yet done in your times of freedom, when\nthe sun rise and set.",
        "At such times you go by my volition and not by\nhis; and this power to good of you and others, you have won from your\nsuffering at his hands.",

        "We, however, are not all selfish, and we believe that God\nis with us through all this blackness, and these many dark hours.",
        "We\nshall follow him; and we shall not flinch; even if we peril ourselves\nthat we become like him.",

        "When the usual time came round Mrs.",
        "Harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort; and after a longer and\nmore strenuous effort on the part of Van Helsing than has been usually\nnecessary, she sank into the trance.",
        "Usually she speaks on a hint; but\nthis time the Professor had to ask her questions, and to ask them pretty\nresolutely, before we could learn anything; at last her answer came:--\n\n\u201cI can see nothing; we are still; there are no waves lapping, but only\na steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser.",
        "I can hear\nmen\u2019s voices calling, near and far, and the roll and creak of oars in\nthe rowlocks.",
        "A gun is fired somewhere; the echo of it seems far away.",

        "There is a gleam of light; I can feel the air\nblowing upon me.\u201d\n\nHere she stopped.",
        "She had risen, as if impulsively, from where she lay\non the sofa, and raised both her hands, palms upwards, as if lifting\na weight.",
        "Van Helsing and I looked at each other with understanding.",
        "Quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently, whilst\nHarker\u2019s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his k\u00fakri.",

        "You must all be so tired!\u201d We\ncould only make her happy, and so acquiesced.",
        "She bustled off to get\ntea; when she had gone Van Helsing said:--\n\n\u201cYou see, my friends.",

        "Early this morning we listened, with breathless anxiety, for her\nresponse in her trance.",
        "The hypnotic stage was even longer in coming\nthan before; and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise\nwas so short that we began to despair.",
        "Van Helsing seemed to throw his\nwhole soul into the effort; at last, in obedience to his will she made\nreply:--\n\n\u201cAll is dark.",
        "I hear lapping water, level with me, and some creaking as\nof wood on wood.\u201d She paused, and the red sun shot up.",

        "The Count wanted isolation.",
        "My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his\nCastle by water, as the most safe and secret way.",
        "He was brought from\nthe Castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks\nwho took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London.",
        "Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this\nservice.",
        "When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he\ncame out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to\narranging the carriage of the box up some river.",
        "When this was done, and\nhe knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought,\nby murdering his agent.",
        "I have examined the map, and find that the river most suitable for the\nSlovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth.",
        "I read in\nthe typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling\nlevel with my ears and the creaking of wood.",
        "The Count in his box, then,\nwas on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or\npoles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream.",
        "There\nwould be no such sound if floating down stream.",
        "Of course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may\npossibly investigate further.",

        "I have to lift her up and place her sleeping in the carriage when\nI have harnessed the horses and made all ready.",
        "Madam still sleep,\nand sleep; and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than\nbefore.",
        "And I like it not.",
        "And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am\nafraid of all things--even to think; but I must go on my way.",
        "The stake\nwe play for is life and death, or more than these, and we must not\nflinch.",
        "_5 November, morning._--Let me be accurate in everything, for though\nyou and I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first\nthink that I, Van Helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so\nlong strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.",
        "All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and\nmoving into a more and more wild and desert land.",
        "There are great,\nfrowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seemed to have\nheld sometime her carnival.",
        "Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and\nthough I did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even\nfor food.",
        "I began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon\nher, tainted as she is with that Vampire baptism.",
        "\u201cWell,\u201d said I to\nmyself, \u201cif it be that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I\ndo not sleep at night.\u201d As we travel on the rough road, for a road of\nan ancient and imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept.",
        "Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam\nMina still sleeping, and the sun low down.",
        "But all was indeed changed;\nthe frowning mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top\nof a steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such as castle as\nJonathan tell of in his diary.",
        "At once I exulted and feared; for now,\nfor good or ill, the end was near.",
        "I woke Madam Mina, and again tried\nto hypnotise her; but alas!",
        "unavailing till too late.",
        "Then, ere the\ngreat dark came upon us--for even after down-sun the heavens reflected\nthe gone sun on the snow, and all was for a time in a great twilight--I\ntook out the horses and fed them in what shelter I could.",
        "Then I make a\nfire; and near it I made Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than\never, sit comfortable amid her rugs.",
        "I got ready food: but she would\nnot eat, simply saying that she had not hunger.",
        "I did not press her,\nknowing her unavailingness.",
        "But I myself eat, for I must needs now be\nstrong for all.",
        "Then, with the fear on me of what might be, I drew a\nring so big for her comfort, round where Madam Mina sat; and over the\nring I passed some of the wafer, and I broke it fine so that all was\nwell guarded.",
        "She sat still all the time--so still as one dead; and she\ngrew whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale; and no\nword she said.",
        "But when I drew near, she clung to me, and I could know\nthat the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a tremor that was\npain to feel.",
        "I said to her presently, when she had grown more quiet:--\n\n\u201cWill you not come over to the fire?\u201d for I wished to make a test of\nwhat she could.",
        "She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she\nstopped, and stood as one stricken.",
        "\u201cWhy not go on?\u201d I asked.",
        "She shook her head, and, coming back, sat\ndown in her place.",
        "Then, looking at me with open eyes, as of one waked\nfrom sleep, she said simply:--\n\n\u201cI cannot!\u201d and remained silent.",
        "I rejoiced, for I knew that what she\ncould not, none of those that we dreaded could.",
        "Though there might be\ndanger to her body, yet her soul was safe!",
        "Presently the horses began to scream, and tore at their tethers till\nI came to them and quieted them.",
        "When they did feel my hands on them,\nthey whinnied low as in joy, and licked at my hands and were quiet\nfor a time.",
        "Many times through the night did I come to them, till it\narrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest; and every time\nmy coming was with quiet of them.",
        "In the cold hour the fire began to\ndie, and I was about stepping forth to replenish it, for now the snow\ncame in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist.",
        "Even in the dark there\nwas a light of some kind, as there ever is over snow; and it seemed as\nthough the snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women\nwith trailing garments.",
        "All was in dead, grim silence, only that the\nhorses whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst.",
        "I began to\nfear--horrible fears; but then came to me the sense of safety in that\nring wherein I stood.",
        "I began, too, to think that my imaginings were\nof the night, and the gloom, and the unrest that I have gone through,\nand all the terrible anxiety.",
        "It was as though my memories of all\nJonathan\u2019s horrid experience were befooling me; for the snow flakes and\nthe mist began to wheel and circle round, till I could get as though\na shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him.",
        "And then\nthe horses cowered lower and lower, and moaned in terror as men do in\npain.",
        "Even the madness of fright was not to them, so that they could\nbreak away.",
        "I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures\ndrew near and circled round.",
        "I looked at her, but she sat calm, and\nsmiled at me; when I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it,\nshe caught me and held me back, and whispered, like a voice that one\nhears in a dream, so low it was:--\n\n\u201cNo!",
        "No!",
        "Do not go without.",
        "Here you are safe!\u201d I turned to her, and\nlooking in her eyes, said:--\n\n\u201cBut you?",
        "It is for you that I fear!\u201d whereat she laughed--a laugh low\nand unreal, and said:--\n\n\u201cFear for _me_!",
        "Why fear for me?",
        "None safer in all the world from them\nthan I am,\u201d and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of\nwind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead.",
        "Then, alas!",
        "I knew.",
        "Did I not, I would soon have learned, for the\nwheeling figures of mist and snow came closer, but keeping ever without\nthe Holy circle.",
        "Then they began to materialise, till--if God have not\ntake away my reason, for I saw it through my eyes--there were before\nme in actual flesh the same three women that Jonathan saw in the room,\nwhen they would have kissed his throat.",
        "I knew the swaying round forms,\nthe bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous\nlips.",
        "They smiled ever at poor dear Madam Mina; and as their laugh came\nthrough the silence of the night, they twined their arms and pointed to\nher, and said in those so sweet tingling tones that Jonathan said were\nof the intolerable sweetness of the water-glasses:--\n\n\u201cCome, sister.",
        "Come to us.",
        "Come!",
        "Come!\u201d In fear I turned to my poor\nMadam Mina, and my heart with gladness leapt like flame; for oh!",
        "the\nterror in her sweet eyes, the repulsion, the horror, told a story to my\nheart that was all of hope.",
        "God be thanked she was not, yet, of them.",
        "I seized some of the firewood which was by me, and holding out some of\nthe Wafer, advanced on them towards the fire.",
        "They drew back before me,\nand laughed their low horrid laugh.",
        "I fed the fire, and feared them\nnot; for I knew that we were safe within our protections.",
        "They could\nnot approach me, whilst so armed, nor Madam Mina whilst she remained\nwithin the ring, which she could not leave no more than they could\nenter.",
        "The horses had ceased to moan, and lay still on the ground; the\nsnow fell on them softly, and they grew whiter.",
        "I knew that there was\nfor the poor beasts no more of terror.",
        "And so we remained till the red of the dawn began to fall through the\nsnow-gloom.",
        "I was desolate and afraid, and full of woe and terror;\nbut when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me\nagain.",
        "At the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the\nwhirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away\ntowards the castle, and were lost.",
        "Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending\nto hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which\nI could not wake her.",
        "I tried to hypnotise through her sleep, but she\nmade no response, none at all; and the day broke.",
        "I fear yet to stir.",
        "I\nhave made my fire and have seen the horses; they are all dead.",
        "To-day I\nhave much to do here, and I keep waiting till the sun is up high; for\nthere may be places where I must go, where that sunlight, though snow\nand mist obscure it, will be to me a safety.",
        "I will strengthen me with breakfast, and then I will to my terrible\nwork.",

        "It may be our\nown excited feelings, but the depression is strange.",
        "Far off I hear\nthe howling of wolves; the snow brings them down from the mountains,\nand there are dangers to all of us, and from all sides.",

        "Jonathan\u2019s bitter experience served\nme here.",
        "By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for\nI knew that here my work lay.",
        "The air was oppressive; it seemed as if\nthere was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy.",
        "Either\nthere was a roaring in my ears or I heard afar off the howl of wolves.",
        "Then I bethought me of my dear Madam Mina, and I was in terrible\nplight.",
        "The dilemma had me between his horns.",
        "Her, I had not dare to\ntake into this place, but left safe from the Vampire in that Holy\ncircle; and yet even there would be the wolf!",

        "At any rate it was only death and freedom beyond.",
        "So did I choose\nfor her.",
        "Had it but been for myself the choice had been easy; the maw\nof the wolf were better to rest in than the grave of the Vampire!",
        "So I\nmake my choice to go on with my work.",
        "I knew that there were at least three graves to find--graves that are\ninhabit; so I search, and search, and I find one of them.",
        "She lay in\nher Vampire sleep, so full of life and voluptuous beauty that I shudder\nas though I have come to do murder.",
        "Ah, I doubt not that in old time,\nwhen such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as\nmine, found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve.",
        "So he\ndelay, and delay, and delay, till the mere beauty and the fascination\nof the wanton Un-Dead have hypnotise him; and he remain on, and on,\ntill sunset come, and the Vampire sleep be over.",
        "Then the beautiful\neyes of the fair woman open and look love, and the voluptuous mouth\npresent to a kiss--and man is weak.",
        "And there remain one more victim in\nthe Vampire fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the\nUn-Dead!...",
        "There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence\nof such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and\nheavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour\nsuch as the lairs of the Count have had.",
        "Yes, I was moved--I, Van\nHelsing, with all my purpose and with my motive for hate--I was moved\nto a yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to\nclog my very soul.",
        "It may have been that the need of natural sleep,\nand the strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me.",
        "Certain it was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of\none who yields to a sweet fascination, when there came through the\nsnow-stilled air a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke\nme like the sound of a clarion.",
        "For it was the voice of my dear Madam\nMina that I heard.",
        "Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching\naway tomb-tops one other of the sisters, the other dark one.",
        "I dared\nnot pause to look on her as I had on her sister, lest once more I\nshould begin to be enthral; but I go on searching until, presently, I\nfind in a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other\nfair sister which, like Jonathan I had seen to gather herself out\nof the atoms of the mist.",
        "She was so fair to look on, so radiantly\nbeautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in\nme, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made\nmy head whirl with new emotion.",
        "But God be thanked, that soul-wail of\nmy dear Madam Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell\ncould be wrought further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work.",
        "By this time I had searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I\ncould tell; and as there had been only three of these Un-Dead phantoms\naround us in the night, I took it that there were no more of active\nUn-Dead existent.",
        "There was one great tomb more lordly than all the\nrest; huge it was, and nobly proportioned.",
        "On it was but one word\n\nDRACULA.",
        "This then was the Un-Dead home of the King-Vampire, to whom so many\nmore were due.",
        "Its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what I\nknew.",
        "Before I began to restore these women to their dead selves\nthrough my awful work, I laid in Dracula\u2019s tomb some of the Wafer, and\nso banished him from it, Un-Dead, for ever.",
        "Then began my terrible task, and I dreaded it.",
        "Had it been but one,\nit had been easy, comparative.",
        "But three!",
        "To begin twice more after\nI had been through a deed of horror; for if it was terrible with the\nsweet Miss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who\nhad survived through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the\npassing of the years; who would, if they could, have fought for their\nfoul lives?...",
        "Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had I not been nerved by\nthoughts of other dead, and of the living over whom hung such a pall of\nfear, I could not have gone on.",
        "I tremble and tremble even yet, though\ntill all was over, God be thanked, my nerve did stand.",
        "Had I not seen\nthe repose in the first face, and the gladness that stole over it just\nere the final dissolution came, as realisation that the soul had been\nwon, I could not have gone further with my butchery.",
        "I could not have\nendured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home; the plunging of\nwrithing form, and lips of bloody foam.",
        "I should have fled in terror\nand left my work undone.",
        "But it is over!",
        "And the poor souls, I can pity\nthem now and weep, as I think of them placid each in her full sleep of\ndeath, for a short moment ere fading.",
        "For, friend John, hardly had my\nknife severed the head of each, before the whole body began to melt\naway and crumble into its native dust, as though the death that should\nhave come centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once\nand loud \u201cI am here!\u201d\n\nBefore I left the castle I so fixed its entrances that never more can\nthe Count enter there Un-Dead.",
        "When I stepped into the circle where Madam Mina slept, she woke from\nher sleep, and seeing me, cried out in pain that I had endured too much.",
        "\u201cCome!\u201d she said, \u201ccome away from this awful place!",
        "Let us go to meet\nmy husband, who is, I know, coming towards us.\u201d She was looking thin\nand pale and weak; but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour.",
        "I\nwas glad to see her paleness and her illness, for my mind was full of\nthe fresh horror of that ruddy Vampire sleep.",
        "And so with trust and hope, and yet full of fear, we go eastward to\nmeet our friends--and _him_--whom Madam Mina tell me that she _know_\nare coming to meet us.",
        "_Mina Harker\u2019s Journal._\n\n_6 November._--It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I\ntook our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming.",
        "We\ndid not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to\ntake heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of\nbeing left without warmth in the cold and the snow.",
        "We had to take some\nof our provisions too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so\nfar as we could see through the snow-fall, there was not even the sign\nof a habitation.",
        "When we had gone about a mile, I was tired with the\nheavy walking and sat down to rest.",
        "Then we looked back and saw where\nthe clear line of Dracula\u2019s castle cut the sky; for we were so deep\nunder the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the\nCarpathian mountains was far below it.",
        "We saw it in all its grandeur,\nperched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice, and with\nseemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain\non any side.",
        "There was something wild and uncanny about the place.",
        "We\ncould hear the distant howling of wolves.",
        "They were far off, but the\nsound, even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall, was\nfull of terror.",
        "I knew from the way Dr.",
        "Van Helsing was searching about\nthat he was trying to seek some strategic point, where we would be less\nexposed in case of attack.",
        "The rough roadway still led downwards; we\ncould trace it through the drifted snow.",
        "In a little while the Professor signalled to me, so I got up and joined\nhim.",
        "He had found a wonderful spot, a sort of natural hollow in a\nrock, with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders.",
        "He took\nme by the hand and drew me in: \u201cSee!\u201d he said, \u201chere you will be in\nshelter; and if the wolves do come I can meet them one by one.\u201d He\nbrought in our furs, and made a snug nest for me, and got out some\nprovisions and forced them upon me.",
        "But I could not eat; to even try to\ndo so was repulsive to me, and, much as I would have liked to please\nhim, I could not bring myself to the attempt.",
        "He looked very sad, but\ndid not reproach me.",
        "Taking his field-glasses from the case, he stood\non the top of the rock, and began to search the horizon.",
        "Suddenly he\ncalled out:--\n\n\u201cLook!",
        "Madam Mina, look!",
        "look!\u201d I sprang up and stood beside him on the\nrock; he handed me his glasses and pointed.",
        "The snow was now falling\nmore heavily, and swirled about fiercely, for a high wind was beginning\nto blow.",
        "However, there were times when there were pauses between the\nsnow flurries, and I could see a long way round.",
        "From the height where\nwe were it was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond\nthe white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black\nribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way.",
        "Straight in front of us\nand not far off--in fact so near that I wondered we had not noticed\nbefore--came a group of mounted men hurrying along.",
        "In the midst of\nthem was a cart, a long leiter-waggon, which swept from side to side,\nlike a dog\u2019s tail wagging, with each stern inequality of the road.",
        "Outlined against the snow as they were, I could see from the men\u2019s\nclothes that they were peasants or gipsies of some kind.",
        "On the cart was a great square chest.",
        "My heart leaped as I saw it, for\nI felt that the end was coming.",
        "The evening was now drawing close, and\nwell I knew that at sunset the Thing, which was till then imprisoned\nthere, would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude\nall pursuit.",
        "In fear I turned to the Professor; to my consternation,\nhowever, he was not there.",
        "An instant later, I saw him below me.",
        "Round\nthe rock he had drawn a circle, such as we had found shelter in last\nnight.",
        "When he had completed it he stood beside me again, saying:--\n\n\u201cAt least you shall be safe here from _him_!\u201d He took the glasses from\nme, and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us.",
        "\u201cSee,\u201d he said, \u201cthey come quickly; they are flogging the horses,\nand galloping as hard as they can.\u201d He paused and went on in a hollow\nvoice:--\n\n\u201cThey are racing for the sunset.",
        "We may be too late.",
        "God\u2019s will be\ndone!\u201d Down came another blinding rush of driving snow, and the whole\nlandscape was blotted out.",
        "It soon passed, however, and once more his\nglasses were fixed on the plain.",
        "Then came a sudden cry:--\n\n\u201cLook!",
        "Look!",
        "Look!",
        "See, two horsemen follow fast, coming up from the\nsouth.",
        "It must be Quincey and John.",
        "Take the glass.",
        "Look, before the\nsnow blots it all out!\u201d I took it and looked.",
        "The two men might be Dr.",
        "Seward and Mr.",
        "Morris.",
        "I knew at all events that neither of them was\nJonathan.",
        "At the same time I _knew_ that Jonathan was not far off;\nlooking around I saw on the north side of the coming party two other\nmen, riding at break-neck speed.",
        "One of them I knew was Jonathan,\nand the other I took, of course, to be Lord Godalming.",
        "They, too,\nwere pursuing the party with the cart.",
        "When I told the Professor he\nshouted in glee like a schoolboy, and, after looking intently till a\nsnowfall made sight impossible, he laid his Winchester rifle ready for\nuse against the boulder at the opening of our shelter.",
        "\u201cThey are all\nconverging,\u201d he said.",
        "\u201cWhen the time comes we shall have the gipsies\non all sides.\u201d I got out my revolver ready to hand, for whilst we\nwere speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer.",

        "Sweeping the glass all around us I could see here and there dots\nmoving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbers--the wolves\nwere gathering for their prey.",
        "Every instant seemed an age whilst we waited.",
        "The wind came now in\nfierce bursts, and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us\nin circling eddies.",
        "At times we could not see an arm\u2019s length before\nus; but at others as the hollow-sounding wind swept by us, it seemed to\nclear the air-space around us so that we could see afar off.",
        "We had of\nlate been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset, that we knew\nwith fair accuracy when it would be; and we knew that before long the\nsun would set.",
        "It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less than an hour\nthat we waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to\nconverge close upon us.",
        "The wind came now with fiercer and more bitter\nsweeps, and more steadily from the north.",
        "It seemingly had driven\nthe snow-clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts, the snow\nfell.",
        "We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party, the\npursued and the pursuers.",
        "Strangely enough those pursued did not seem\nto realize, or at least to care, that they were pursued; they seemed,\nhowever, to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and\nlower on the mountain tops.",
        "Closer and closer they drew.",
        "The Professor and I crouched down\nbehind our rock, and held our weapons ready; I could see that he was\ndetermined that they should not pass.",
        "One and all were quite unaware of\nour presence.",
        "All at once two voices shouted out to: \u201cHalt!\u201d One was my Jonathan\u2019s,\nraised in a high key of passion; the other Mr.",
        "Morris\u2019s strong resolute\ntone of quiet command.",
        "The gipsies may not have known the language,\nbut there was no mistaking the tone, in whatever tongue the words were\nspoken.",
        "Instinctively they reined in, and at the instant Lord Godalming\nand Jonathan dashed up at one side and Dr.",
        "Seward and Mr.",
        "Morris on the\nother.",
        "The leader of the gipsies, a splendid looking fellow, who sat\nhis horse like a centaur, waved them back, and in a fierce voice gave\nto his companions some word to proceed.",
        "They lashed the horses, which\nsprang forward; but the four men raised their Winchester rifles, and\nin an unmistakable way commanded them to stop.",
        "At the same moment Dr.",
        "Van Helsing and I rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them.",
        "Seeing that they were surrounded, the men tightened their reins and\ndrew up.",
        "The leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man\nof the gipsy party drew what weapon he carried, knife or pistol, and\nheld himself in readiness to attack.",
        "Issue was joined in an instant.",
        "The leader, with a quick movement of his rein, threw his horse out\nin front, and pointing first to the sun--now close down on the\nhill-tops--and then to the castle, said something which I did not\nunderstand.",
        "For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves\nfrom their horses and dashed towards the cart.",
        "I should have felt\nterrible fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardour of\nbattle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them; I felt no\nfear, but only a wild, surging desire to do something.",
        "Seeing a quick\nmovement of our parties, the leader of the gipsies gave a command;\nhis men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined\nendeavour, each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness\nto carry out the order.",
        "In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring\nof men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it\nwas evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun\nshould set.",
        "Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them.",
        "Neither the\nlevelled weapons or the flashing knives of the gipsies in front, or the\nhowling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their attention.",
        "Jonathan\u2019s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his purpose,\nseemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they cowered\naside and let him pass.",
        "In an instant he had jumped upon the cart,\nand, with a strength which seemed incredible, raised the great box,\nand flung it over the wheel to the ground.",
        "In the meantime, Mr.",
        "Morris\nhad had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of Szgany.",
        "All the time I had been breathlessly watching Jonathan I had, with the\ntail of my eye, seen him pressing desperately forward, and had seen\nthe knives of the gipsies flash as he won a way through them, and they\ncut at him.",
        "He had parried with his great bowie knife, and at first I\nthought that he too had come through in safety; but as he sprang beside\nJonathan, who had by now jumped from the cart, I could see that with\nhis left hand he was clutching at his side, and that the blood was\nspurting through his fingers.",
        "He did not delay notwithstanding this,\nfor as Jonathan, with desperate energy, attacked one end of the chest,\nattempting to prise off the lid with his great kukri knife, he attacked\nthe other frantically with his bowie.",
        "Under the efforts of both men the\nlid began to yield; the nails drew with a quick screeching sound, and\nthe top of the box was thrown back.",
        "By this time the gipsies, seeing themselves covered by the Winchesters,\nand at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr.",
        "Seward, had given in and\nmade no further resistance.",
        "The sun was almost down on the mountain\ntops, and the shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow.",
        "I\nsaw the Count lying within the box upon the earth, some of which the\nrude falling from the cart had scattered over him.",
        "He was deathly pale,\njust like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible\nvindictive look which I knew too well.",
        "As I looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them\nturned to triumph.",
        "But, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of Jonathan\u2019s great\nknife.",
        "I shrieked as I saw it shear through the throat; whilst at the\nsame moment Mr.",
        "Morris\u2019 bowie knife plunged in the heart.",
        "It was like a miracle; but before our very eyes, and almost in the\ndrawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from\nour sight.",
        "I shall be glad as long as I live that even in that moment of final\ndissolution there was in the face a look of peace, such as I never\ncould have imagined might have rested there.",
        "The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every\nstone of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of\nthe setting sun.",
        "The gipsies, taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary\ndisappearance of the dead man, turned, without a word, and rode away\nas if for their lives.",
        "Those who were unmounted jumped upon the\nleiter-waggon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them.",
        "The\nwolves, which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake,\nleaving us alone.",
        "Mr.",
        "Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding\nhis hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his\nfingers.",
        "I flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back;\nso did the two doctors.",
        "Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man\nlaid back his head on his shoulder.",
        "With a sigh he took, with a feeble\neffort, my hand in that of his own which was unstained.",
        "He must have\nseen the anguish of my heart in my face, for he smiled at me and\nsaid:--\n\n\u201cI am only too happy to have been of any service!",
        "Oh, God!\u201d he cried\nsuddenly, struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me, \u201cIt\nwas worth this to die!",
        "Look!",
        "look!\u201d\n\nThe sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams\nfell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light.",
        "With one\nimpulse the men sank on their knees, and a deep and earnest \u201cAmen\u201d\nbroke from all as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger as the\ndying man spoke:--\n\n\u201cNow God be thanked that all has not been in vain!",
        "See!",
        "the snow is not\nmore stainless than her forehead!",
        "The curse has passed away!\u201d\n\nAnd, to our bitter grief, with a smile and in silence, he died, a\ngallant gentleman.",
        "NOTE.",
        "Seven years ago we all went through the flames; and the happiness of\nsome of us since then is, we think, well worth the pain we endured.",
        "It\nis an added joy to Mina and to me that our boy\u2019s birthday is the same\nday as that on which Quincey Morris died.",
        "His mother holds, I know, the\nsecret belief that some of our brave friend\u2019s spirit has passed into\nhim.",
        "His bundle of names links all our little band of men together; but\nwe call him Quincey.",
        "In the summer of this year we made a journey to Transylvania, and went\nover the old ground which was, and is, to us so full of vivid and\nterrible memories.",
        "It was almost impossible to believe that the things\nwhich we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were\nliving truths.",
        "Every trace of all that had been was blotted out.",
        "The\ncastle stood as before, reared high above a waste of desolation.",
        "When we got home we got to talking of the old time--which we could all\nlook back on without despair, for Godalming and Seward are both happily\nmarried.",
        "I took the papers from the safe where they have been ever\nsince our return so long ago.",
        "We were struck with the fact, that in all\nthe mass of material of which the record is composed, there is hardly\none authentic document; nothing but a mass of type-writing, except\nthe later note-books of Mina and Seward and myself, and Van Helsing\u2019s\nmemorandum.",
        "We could hardly ask any one, even did we wish to, to accept\nthese as proofs of so wild a story.",
        "Van Helsing summed it all up as he\nsaid, with our boy on his knee:--\n\n\u201cWe want no proofs; we ask none to believe us!",
        "This boy will some day\nknow what a brave and gallant woman his mother is.",
